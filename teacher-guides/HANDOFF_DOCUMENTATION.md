# PFL Academy Project Handoff Documentation

## Project Overview

The PFL Academy curriculum has been fully developed and is ready for technical implementation. This document provides essential information for the development team to understand the content architecture, file organization, and implementation considerations.

## Content Summary

- **15 Standards** covering comprehensive personal finance education
- **46 Chapters** with complete curriculum content
- **All chapters include**:
  - Day 1 content (conceptual learning)
  - Day 2 Learning Labs (practical application)
  - Teacher guides for both days
  - Downloadable resources
  - Additional resource references

## File Organization

### Primary Content Locations

1. **Teacher Guides**
   ```
   /Teacher-guides/Standard-X/
   ```
   - Naming pattern: `chapter-X-Y-teacher-day1.md` and `chapter-X-Y-teacher-day2.md`
   - Example: `/Teacher-guides/Standard-2/chapter-2-3-teacher-day1.md`

2. **Additional Resources**
   ```
   /resources/chapter-X-Y/additional-resources/
   ```
   - Primary file: `content.md` (with a few exceptions using `index.html` or `additional-resources.md`)
   - Example: `/resources/chapter-5-3/additional-resources/content.md`

3. **Downloadable Materials**
   ```
   /resources/chapter-X-Y/downloads/
   ```
   - Multiple HTML resources in each directory
   - ZIP package named `chapter-X-Y-materials.zip` containing all HTML files
   - Example: `/resources/chapter-7-2/downloads/chapter-7-2-materials.zip`

## Template Files Reference

### Key Templates for Implementation

1. **Teacher Guide Templates**
   ```
   /teacher-guide-markd.md
   ```
   - Contains both Day 1 and Day 2 teacher guide templates
   - Includes all required sections and formatting

2. **Additional Resources Template**
   ```
   /resources/additional-resources-markdown-template.md
   ```
   - Template for additional resources content
   - Includes standard sections and formatting for resources

## Implementation Considerations

### CSS & Styling

All templates use consistent styling with these key classes:

1. **Common UI Components**:
   - Learning objectives: `learning-objectives` class
   - Discussion prompts: `discussion-prompt` class
   - Case studies: `case-study` class 
   - Activity timers: `activity-timer` class
   - Station indicators: `station-indicator` class

2. **Layout Elements**:
   - Page header: `header` class with indigo gradient
   - Navigation sidebar: `sidebar` class
   - Content area: `main-content` class
   - Footer: `footer` class

3. **Interactive Components**:
   - Learning stations: `learning-station` class
   - Save buttons: `pfl-button` class
   - Toast notifications: `toast-notification` class
   - Progress indicators: `progress-indicator` class

### JavaScript Functionality

Key JavaScript functions to implement:

1. **Progress Tracking**:
   - `updateProgress()` - Updates station completion status
   - `saveProgress()` - Saves progress to local storage/database
   - `loadProgress()` - Loads existing progress

2. **Navigation**:
   - `navigateToSection()` - Scrolls to specific sections
   - `toggleSidebar()` - Controls sidebar visibility on mobile

3. **Interactive Elements**:
   - `saveStationWork()` - Saves work from individual stations
   - `showToast()` - Displays notification messages
   - `validateInput()` - Validates user input in forms

## Testing Recommendations

Prioritize testing these components:

1. **Teacher Guide Functionality**:
   - Test instructor support features
   - Verify downloadable resources are accessible
   - Confirm proper rendering of markdown content

2. **Responsive Design**:
   - Test on various device sizes (desktop, tablet, mobile)
   - Verify navigation and UI components adjust properly

3. **Resource Accessibility**:
   - Ensure downloadable files can be accessed
   - Verify ZIP packages contain all required files
   - Check that print functionality works in resource files

## Additional Notes

- All markdown content should be rendered with a compatible markdown parser that supports GitHub-flavored markdown
- The teacher guides include special formatting that should be preserved in the rendered output
- Consider implementing a search functionality to allow teachers to quickly find specific topics or resources
- Include print functionality for all teacher guides and resources
