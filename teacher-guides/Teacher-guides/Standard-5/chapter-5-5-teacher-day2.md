## Detailed Facilitation Notes

### Warm-up & Review (10 minutes)

- Welcome students and frame the Learning Lab as an opportunity to apply what they learned about financial risks and risk tolerance
- Explain that today's activities will help them develop practical skills in managing different types of financial risks
- Play the podcast review (5 minutes) which recaps the key concepts from Day 1:
  - Types of financial risks: market, financial, inflation, and fraud
  - Risk tolerance and its personal nature
  - Diversification and asset allocation as risk management strategies
- After the podcast, facilitate a brief Q&A to address any questions from Day 1
- Have students retrieve their risk tolerance profiles from the previous lesson

**Facilitation Tip**: Use a quick poll to gauge student comfort with the concepts from Day 1. This can help identify areas that may need additional clarification before proceeding with the Learning Lab activities.

### Investment Strategy Simulator (20 minutes)

#### Setup & Introduction
- Direct students to access the Investment Strategy Simulator tool
- Explain that they'll create investment allocations for three different time horizons
- Review the economic scenarios they'll use to test their allocations
- Demonstrate how to use the allocation sliders and scenario selection features
- Explain how to interpret the performance results

#### During the Activity
- Instruct students to create allocations for three time horizons:
  1. Short-term goal (1-3 years): e.g., car purchase, vacation
  2. Medium-term goal (5-10 years): e.g., home down payment
  3. Long-term goal (30+ years): e.g., retirement
- For each time horizon, students should:
  - Create an investment allocation using the simulator
  - Test the allocation under different economic scenarios
  - Analyze how the allocation performs
  - Make adjustments based on performance results
  - Document their final allocation and reasoning
- Remind students to consider their personal risk tolerance from Day 1 when creating allocations
- Encourage them to note differences in their allocations across time horizons

#### Support Strategies
- Circulate around the room to assist students who may be struggling with the simulator
- Provide guidance on interpreting performance results
- Ask guiding questions to help students connect risk tolerance to allocation decisions
- For students who finish early, suggest they test additional economic scenarios or create more detailed analyses

#### Monitoring Points:
- Check that students are testing their allocations across all economic scenarios
- Observe whether students are creating different allocations for different time horizons
- Ensure students are documenting their reasoning, not just their final allocations
- Look for students who might be creating unsuitable allocations (e.g., extremely aggressive for short-term)

**Specific Questions to Pose to Students:**
- "How does your short-term allocation differ from your long-term allocation, and why?"
- "Which economic scenario impacts your allocation most significantly?"
- "How does your personal risk tolerance influence your decisions for each time horizon?"
- "What would happen if you used your long-term allocation for a short-term goal?"

### Risk Management Plan (15 minutes)

#### Setup & Introduction
- Introduce the Risk Management Plan as a comprehensive strategy document
- Explain the four components students need to address:
  1. Current Risk Profile
  2. Risk Mitigation Strategies
  3. Life Changes
  4. Emergency Preparedness
- Show examples of what a completed plan might look like
- Emphasize the importance of tailoring the plan to personal circumstances

#### During the Activity
- Guide students to complete each section of their plan:
  - **Current Risk Profile**: Summarize their risk tolerance and explain if it's appropriate for their life stage
  - **Risk Mitigation Strategies**: Identify specific strategies for each risk type:
    - Market risk (e.g., long-term investment horizon, dollar-cost averaging)
    - Financial risk (e.g., company research, diversity across industries)
    - Inflation risk (e.g., growth investments, TIPS)
    - Fraud risk (e.g., verification procedures, red flag awareness)
  - **Life Changes**: Describe how their risk tolerance might need to change during:
    - Graduating from college
    - Starting a family
    - Approaching retirement
  - **Emergency Preparedness**: Explain the role of an emergency fund and how much they should ideally save
- Encourage students to be specific and practical with their strategies

#### Discussion Prompts:
- "How might your approach to market risk differ from your approach to fraud risk?"
- "Which life transition do you think would most significantly change your risk tolerance?"
- "How does an emergency fund function as part of a risk management strategy?"
- "Which risk type do you feel most vulnerable to, and how will you address it?"

**Guidance Note**: Emphasize that a good risk management plan is personalized, comprehensive, and flexible. It should address all major risk types while acknowledging individual circumstances and goals.

### Portfolio Integration (5 minutes)

#### Setup & Introduction
- Direct students to access their financial goals from previous chapters
- Explain that they'll now integrate their risk management strategies into their overall financial portfolio
- Provide a framework for evaluating whether their current strategies align with their risk tolerance

#### During the Activity
- Have students:
  1. Review their current financial goals from previous chapters
  2. Assess whether their risk tolerance aligns with these goals
  3. Recommend adjustments to their savings or investment strategy based on their risk profile
  4. Create a timeline for reviewing and potentially adjusting their risk management plan
- Encourage them to think about how different goals might require different risk approaches
- Emphasize the importance of regular review and adjustment of risk strategies

#### Integration Questions:
- "How might your understanding of risk change your approach to your financial goals?"
- "Which of your financial goals might need reframing based on your risk tolerance?"
- "How frequently should you review your risk management strategies, and why?"
- "What events might trigger a need to reassess your risk management plan?"

### Reflection & Wrap-up (5 minutes)

#### Portfolio Completion
- Guide students in finalizing their portfolio entries
- Ask them to summarize their key insights about risk management
- Have students identify one specific action they plan to take based on what they've learned
- Encourage them to consider how their understanding of risk has evolved

#### Sharing Insights
- Facilitate a brief sharing session where 2-3 volunteers share their key takeaways
- Ask students to identify which risk management strategy they found most valuable
- Discuss how understanding risk tolerance changes their thinking about financial decisions
- Connect today's learning to future financial decisions they'll make

#### Closing Message:
Understanding and managing financial risks is an ongoing process that evolves with your life circumstances and financial goals. The skills you've developed today—creating appropriate investment allocations, developing risk mitigation strategies, and adjusting your approach based on time horizons—will serve you throughout your financial life. Remember that there's no single "right" approach to risk; the key is aligning your strategies with your personal risk tolerance and financial objectives.

## Differentiation Strategies

### For Advanced Students
- Challenge them to create more complex investment allocations with specific percentages for subclasses (e.g., different types of stocks, bonds)
- Ask them to analyze historical market events and how different risk management strategies would have performed
- Have them create multiple risk management plans for different life stages and compare the differences
- Encourage them to research and incorporate more sophisticated risk management tools (options, hedging, etc.)
- Invite them to develop a risk management framework that incorporates additional risk types

### For Struggling Students
- Provide pre-formatted templates for the risk management plan
- Offer simplified investment allocation options (e.g., three basic choices instead of sliders)
- Create a step-by-step guided worksheet for the simulator activity
- Provide concrete examples of risk management strategies for each risk type
- Use visual aids to illustrate the relationship between time horizons and risk
