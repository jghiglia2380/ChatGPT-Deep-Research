## Detailed Facilitation Notes

### Warm-up & Review (5 minutes)

- Begin by having students listen to the brief podcast recap of saving and investing concepts
- Ask students to refer to their Saving vs. Investing Comparison Charts from Day 1
- Have students share 1-2 key takeaways from Day 1 that they found most valuable
- Briefly outline the stations they'll explore today and how they build on Day 1 concepts
- Set expectations for the station rotation and portfolio integration activity

**Facilitation Tip**: Emphasize connections between the Day 1 conceptual understanding and today's practical applications. Remind students that these tools mirror real-world financial planning processes.

### Station 1: Power of Compounding Calculator (10 minutes)

- Explain that this tool demonstrates the concept of compounding introduced in Day 1
- Point out the key input variables: initial investment, contribution amount, interest rate, and time period
- Show students how to generate and interpret the calculation results and graphs
- Demonstrate how to compare different scenarios by changing variables

#### During the Activity
- Encourage students to test different time periods to see the dramatic difference time makes
- Suggest they compare a one-time investment versus regular contributions
- Prompt students to test how different interest rates affect long-term results
- Challenge them to calculate how much they would need to invest to reach specific financial goals
- Encourage them to take screenshots or notes of their most important calculations

#### Group Sharing
- Ask volunteers to share the most surprising insight they discovered about compounding
- Have students compare the impact of starting early versus waiting even a few years
- Discuss the relationship between interest rates and investment growth
- Connect observations to appropriate investment choices for long-term goals

#### Key Questions to Pose:
- "How much difference did you observe between investing for 10 years versus 30 years?"
- "What impact did changing the interest rate have on your long-term results?"
- "Which had a bigger impact on your end result: increasing the initial investment or increasing the monthly contribution?"
- "Based on these calculations, why might investments be particularly appropriate for retirement planning?"

### Station 2: Risk vs. Reward Analysis (10 minutes)

#### Setup & Introduction
- Direct students to the Risk vs. Reward Analysis Tool
- Explain that this interactive spectrum allows them to evaluate different investment options
- Review the basic principle that higher potential returns typically come with higher risk
- Show students how to position different investment types on the risk-reward spectrum
- Demonstrate how to read the detailed information for each investment option

#### During the Activity
- Have students analyze 6-8 different investment options on the spectrum
- Ask them to note the historical returns and volatility for different options
- Encourage them to consider how time horizon affects appropriate risk levels
- Prompt them to think about how different investments might work together in a portfolio
- Have them match appropriate investment types to different financial goals

#### Support Strategies
- Provide a reference guide with descriptions of different investment types
- Create a visual reminder of how time horizon relates to appropriate risk levels
- Check in with students who seem confused about investment terminology
- Use analogies to help explain risk-reward relationships

#### Monitoring Points:
- Check that students understand the relationship between risk and potential returns
- Ensure they're considering time horizon when evaluating appropriate risk levels
- Watch for misconceptions about specific investment types
- Look for students who can articulate why diversification helps manage risk

### Station 3: Investment Strategy Simulator (10 minutes)

#### Setup & Introduction

#### During the Activity
- Present students with 2-3 different financial scenarios with varying goals and time horizons
- Have them create appropriate portfolio allocations for each scenario
- Ask them to justify their allocation choices based on risk, time horizon, and purpose
- Encourage them to test how changing allocations affects potential outcomes
- Prompt them to consider how their personal risk tolerance might influence their decisions

#### Discussion Prompts:
- "How did you adjust your investment allocations for short-term versus long-term goals?"
- "Which scenario was most challenging to create a strategy for, and why?"
- "How did your strategy balance growth potential with risk management?"
- "What considerations beyond time horizon influenced your allocation decisions?"

**Guidance Note**: Emphasize that there isn't a single "correct" portfolio allocationâ€”different approaches can be appropriate based on individual circumstances, goals, and risk tolerance.

### Station 4: Portfolio Integration (10 minutes)

#### Setup & Introduction

- Show students how to use the Portfolio Builder template to organize their plan
- Emphasize that this activity integrates all concepts from previous stations

#### During the Activity
- Have students define 2-3 personal financial goals with specific timeframes
- Ask them to determine whether each goal is best suited for saving, investing, or a combined approach
- Guide them to select appropriate accounts or investment types for each goal
- Encourage them to create a visual representation of their overall financial strategy
- Have them include specific action steps to implement their plan

#### Discussion Prompts:
- "How did the compounding calculations influence your long-term investing strategy?"
- "What role does your personal risk tolerance play in your portfolio decisions?"
- "How did you incorporate the concept of diversification into your plan?"
- "What was the most important insight you gained from building your portfolio?"

### Reflection & Assessment (10 minutes)

#### Portfolio Completion
- Allow students a few minutes to finalize their portfolios
- Encourage them to add specific next steps for implementing their strategy

#### Sharing Insights
- Invite volunteers to share key elements of their portfolio strategy
- Ask students to discuss how their understanding of saving and investing has evolved
- Have students identify which interactive tool they found most valuable and why
- Encourage them to share how they might apply these concepts to their current financial decisions

#### Exit Assessment
- Direct students to complete the exit assessment quiz
- Explain that this will help them identify areas of strength and opportunities for further learning
- Clarify that the assessment covers both Day 1 concepts and Day 2 applications
- Encourage honest self-evaluation rather than focusing on "correct" answers
