## Detailed Facilitation Notes

### Warm-up & Review (10 minutes)

- Begin by having students listen to the podcast that reviews key concepts from Day 1
- After listening, ask students to recall the main differences between saving and investing
- Have students share one insight they found most useful from Day 1
- Briefly review the risk-return relationship using the visual spectrum
- Remind students of the different investment vehicles discussed (savings accounts, CDs, bonds, mutual funds, stocks, etc.)

**Facilitation Tip**: Create a collaborative mind map on the board where students can add key terms and concepts they remember from Day 1. This creates a visual reference they can use throughout the Learning Lab.

### Introduction to Strategy Builder (5 minutes)

#### Setup & Introduction
- Explain that today's Learning Lab will help students create their own personalized investment strategies
- Outline the four stations they'll move through: goal identification, risk assessment, strategy development, and analysis
- Clarify that this is an educational exercise to practice decision-making, not actual financial advice
- Emphasize that there are no universally "right" or "wrong" strategies—the key is alignment with personal goals and risk tolerance
- Demonstrate how to access and navigate the digital Strategy Builder

#### During the Activity
- Project the Strategy Builder interface and explain the different sections
- Show students how their work will automatically progress through the stations
- Clarify how to save their work between stations
- Set clear expectations for time management at each station

#### Group Sharing
- Establish ground rules for respectful discussion about different approaches
- Emphasize that different strategies reflect different goals and preferences, not better/worse decisions
- Prepare students to share insights rather than specific dollar amounts or personal financial details

#### Key Questions to Pose:
- "How might your investment strategy differ from your classmates' strategies, and why is that okay?"
- "Why is it important to start with your goals before choosing investment vehicles?"
- "How might your strategy today change as you move through different life stages?"
- "What factors besides potential returns should you consider when developing an investment strategy?"

### Station 1: Financial Goal Identification (10 minutes)

#### Setup & Introduction
- Explain that the foundation of any investment strategy is clear financial goals
- Review the three time horizons: short-term (0-3 years), medium-term (3-10 years), and long-term (10+ years)
- Provide examples of goals that might fit each time horizon
- Demonstrate how to enter goals and amounts in the digital builder

#### During the Activity
- Encourage students to identify at least one goal for each time horizon
- Remind students to be as specific as possible with their goals
- Prompt students to estimate realistic dollar amounts needed for each goal
- Suggest that students consider both essential goals (education, housing) and lifestyle goals (travel, hobbies)

#### Support Strategies
- For students struggling to identify goals, provide a list of common financial goals as inspiration
- For students hesitant to share specific goals, offer the option to use hypothetical scenarios
- Help students who identify only short-term goals to think further into the future
- Guide students who set unrealistic amounts through a quick reality-check calculation

#### Monitoring Points:
- Check that students are categorizing goals into appropriate time horizons
- Ensure students are providing sufficient detail to guide later investment decisions
- Watch for students who may need help connecting abstract financial concepts to personal goals
- Look for opportunities to help students refine vague goals into specific, measurable objectives

### Station 2: Risk Tolerance Assessment (5 minutes)

#### Setup & Introduction
- Explain that risk tolerance is one's personal comfort level with investment uncertainty
- Clarify that risk tolerance is influenced by both psychological factors and practical considerations
- Preview the risk tolerance questionnaire and how it will help inform their investment choices
- Emphasize that there are no "right" or "wrong" answers—just honest self-assessment

#### During the Activity
- Guide students through completing the risk tolerance questionnaire
- Encourage thoughtful consideration rather than quick responses
- Remind students that risk tolerance may vary for different financial goals
- Help students interpret their results on the conservative to aggressive spectrum

#### Discussion Prompts:
- "Were you surprised by your risk tolerance results? Why or why not?"
- "How might your current life stage affect your risk tolerance?"
- "How might your risk tolerance change as you get older or as your financial situation changes?"
- "How does your risk tolerance align with the time horizons of your financial goals?"

**Guidance Note**: Some students may feel that their risk tolerance reflects on their character (conservative = cautious/fearful, aggressive = brave/reckless). Emphasize that risk tolerance is a neutral characteristic related to personal circumstances and preferences, not a value judgment.

### Station 3: Strategy Development (15 minutes)

#### Setup & Introduction
- Review the Investment Options Reference Guide with key details about each vehicle
- Explain the process of matching investment vehicles to specific goals based on time horizon and risk tolerance
- Demonstrate how to allocate percentages between different investment vehicles
- Emphasize the importance of justifying choices with clear rationales

#### During the Activity
- Remind students to consider the time horizon for each goal when selecting vehicles
- Encourage students to refer to their Day 1 Skill Builder work when evaluating options
- Prompt students to think about diversification within each time horizon
- Guide students to consider both primary and secondary investment vehicles for each goal

#### Support Strategies
- For struggling students, suggest starting with the simplest matches (e.g., savings accounts for short-term goals)
- Provide a decision tree to help students systematically evaluate options
- Offer simplified allocation suggestions for students who need additional guidance
- Create a quick-reference matching guide for common goals and appropriate vehicles

#### Monitoring Points:
- Check that students are matching appropriate vehicles to their time horizons
- Ensure allocations reflect reasonable diversification strategies
- Watch for common misconceptions (e.g., stocks for short-term goals)
- Look for thoughtful justifications that consider multiple factors
- Identify students who may need help balancing risk across their entire strategy

### Station 4: Analysis Dashboard (5 minutes)

#### Setup & Introduction
- Explain how the dashboard visualizes their overall investment strategy
- Review the charts and metrics used to analyze their approach
- Demonstrate how to interpret the asset allocation by time horizon
- Show how the risk-return profile helps evaluate the strategy's balance

#### During the Activity
- Guide students through generating their dashboard visualizations
- Help students interpret what the charts reveal about their strategy
- Prompt students to consider whether their strategy aligns with their goals and risk tolerance
- Encourage students to identify potential adjustments to improve their approach

#### Discussion Prompts:
- "What does your asset allocation chart tell you about your overall approach?"
- "How well does your risk-return profile align with your stated risk tolerance?"
- "What adjustments might you make to better align your strategy with your goals?"
- "How does your strategy balance growth potential with stability and security?"

**Guidance Note**: This analysis stage is crucial for helping students see the "big picture" of their strategy. Encourage them to think critically rather than simply completing the exercise.

### Portfolio Integration & Reflection (5 minutes)

#### Portfolio Completion
- Guide students in creating a summary of their overall investment strategy
- Prompt them to review how different elements work together
- Ensure their portfolio connects specific vehicles to specific goals
- Help students check for internal consistency in their approach

#### Sharing Insights
- Invite volunteers to share one insight they gained from creating their strategy
- Encourage discussion of different approaches and the reasoning behind them
- Highlight the diversity of strategies as a reflection of different goals and preferences
- Ask students to identify one aspect of their strategy they feel confident about and one they'd like to research further

#### Closing Message:
Emphasize that investment strategies evolve over time as circumstances, goals, and market conditions change. The process they've learned today—identifying goals, assessing risk tolerance, matching appropriate vehicles, and analyzing the overall approach—will serve them throughout their financial lives. Encourage students to continue learning about investing as an ongoing process rather than a one-time decision.

## Differentiation Strategies

### For Advanced Students
- Challenge them to create multiple strategy scenarios with different risk profiles
- Ask them to research and incorporate more complex investment vehicles (REITs, ETFs, etc.)
- Have them calculate potential long-term outcomes using compound interest formulas
- Encourage them to consider tax implications in their strategy development
- Prompt them to analyze how economic factors might affect different parts of their strategy

### For Struggling Students
- Provide a simplified version of the strategy builder with fewer options
- Offer template strategies for common goals that they can modify
- Focus on matching just one appropriate vehicle to each time horizon
- Use a visual color-coding system to match risk levels to appropriate vehicles
- Provide additional guided practice with direct feedback before independent work

### For ELL Students
- Create a visual glossary of key investment terms with simple definitions
- Provide sentence frames for strategy justifications
- Use visual representations of risk-return relationships
- Offer audio support for written instructions
- Allow collaboration with peers for language support while maintaining individual decision-making

## Assessment Strategies

### Formative Assessment

## Summative Assessment Guide

### Learning Lab Deliverable: Personalized Investment Strategy Portfolio

#### Assessment Criteria
- Appropriate matching of investment vehicles to financial goals based on time horizons
- Alignment of strategy with assessed risk tolerance
- Logical allocation percentages within and across time horizons
- Thoughtful justifications for investment choices that reference key concepts
- Critical analysis of the overall strategy's strengths and potential improvements

#### Success Indicators
- **Excellent Work**: Strategy demonstrates sophisticated understanding of risk-return relationships; vehicles perfectly match appropriate time horizons; allocations reflect thoughtful diversification; justifications include multiple relevant factors; and analysis identifies specific strengths and actionable improvements.
- **Proficient Work**: Strategy shows sound understanding of basic investment principles; vehicles generally match appropriate time horizons; allocations reflect basic diversification; justifications reference key concepts; and analysis identifies general strengths and potential improvements.
- **Needs Improvement**: Strategy shows limited understanding of investment concepts; vehicle selections often mismatched with time horizons; little evidence of intentional diversification; minimal or vague justifications; and superficial analysis lacking specific insights.

**Recommendation**: Provide feedback that acknowledges the personal nature of investment decisions while still evaluating the application of core concepts. Focus on the decision-making process rather than specific vehicle selections.
