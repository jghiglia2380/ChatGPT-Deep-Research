## Detailed Facilitation Notes

### Warm-up & Review (5 minutes)

- Begin by having students retrieve their Day 1 Compound Interest Worksheet to refresh their memory
- Play the podcast (or excerpt) about compound interest as students settle in
- Ask for 2-3 volunteers to explain the Rule of 72 in their own words
- Address any common misconceptions evident from Day 1 work:
  - Clarify that annual interest rates (not total growth) are used in the Rule of 72
  - Reinforce that "doubling time" refers to the entire amount (principal plus interest)
  - Emphasize that compounding frequency (daily, monthly, yearly) affects the final amount

**Facilitation Tip**: As students explain the Rule of 72, have them provide a concrete example (e.g., "At 8% interest, money doubles in approximately 9 years because 72 ÷ 8 = 9") to ensure they truly understand the concept.

### Activity 1: Compound Interest Simulator (15 minutes)

#### Setup & Introduction
- Direct students to the interactive Compound Interest Simulator
- Demonstrate the basic functionality of the simulator, showing how to adjust variables
- Explain that students should experiment with different combinations of:
  - Initial investment amounts
  - Monthly contribution amounts
  - Interest rates
  - Time periods
- Provide students with specific scenarios to test first before free exploration

#### During the Activity
- Encourage students to test extreme cases (very long time periods, higher interest rates) to see dramatic results
- Have students record key observations from at least 3 different simulations
- Ask students to find the combination that results in $1 million with the smallest initial investment
- Challenge students to determine how changes in monthly contributions compare to changes in interest rates or time in terms of impact

#### Group Sharing
- After individual exploration, have students share surprising findings
- Create a class chart of "most impactful variables" based on student discoveries
- Discuss any patterns or insights students identified (e.g., the exponential growth curve, the impact of small rate increases)
- Connect findings back to the Rule of 72 principles covered in Day 1

#### Key Questions to Pose:
- "What impacts your final balance more: increasing your interest rate by 1% or extending your investment time by 5 years?"
- "How much would you need to invest monthly at age 18 to reach $1 million by age 65, assuming a 7% average return?"
- "If you could only change one variable (initial amount, monthly contribution, interest rate, or time), which would have the biggest impact on your results?"
- "What surprised you most when experimenting with the simulator?"

### Activity 2: Personal Savings Plan (20 minutes)

#### Setup & Introduction
- Transition students from the simulator to the Goal-Setting Worksheet
- Explain that they will apply what they've learned to create a realistic savings plan for personal financial goals
- The activity involves:
  - Selecting 1-2 specific financial goals (short-term and long-term)
  - Determining target amounts and timeframes
  - Calculating required savings using compound interest principles
  - Creating a savings strategy with specific action steps
- Model the process with a sample goal such as saving for a car or college tuition

#### During the Activity
- Encourage students to be specific and realistic with their goals
- Remind students to reference their simulator findings when developing their plans
- Guide students to consider different approaches to reach their goals (e.g., higher initial investment vs. larger monthly contributions)
- Prompt students to document both the mathematical calculations and their practical savings strategies
- Assist struggling students with realistic interest rate assumptions based on current financial products

#### Support Strategies
- For students who struggle identifying goals, provide a list of common financial objectives (car, education, house down payment, retirement)
- Help students break down large goals into manageable steps
- Provide reference sheets with current interest rates for various savings and investment vehicles
- For complex calculations, allow students to use online compound interest calculators

#### Monitoring Points:
- Check that students' math calculations are reasonable and accurate
- Ensure students are connecting their savings plans to specific actions they can take
- Watch for students who might be setting unrealistic goals or using impractical interest rate assumptions
- Observe whether students are considering the trade-offs between different approaches

### Activity 3: Time Value of Money Challenge (10 minutes)

#### Setup & Introduction
- Introduce the concept of opportunity cost as it relates to financial decisions
- Distribute the Time Value of Money Challenge Scenarios
- Explain that each scenario presents a choice between immediate spending and future growth
- Clarify that students should:
  - Calculate the future value of money not spent today
  - Determine what they would gain or lose in each scenario
  - Decide what they would personally choose and explain their reasoning
  - Consider both financial and non-financial factors in their decisions

#### During the Activity
- Remind students to use the Rule of 72 or compound interest calculations in their analysis
- Encourage students to consider both mathematical outcomes and personal preferences/values
- Challenge students to identify a "breakeven point" where the future value would make them change their decision
- Prompt students to think about how different life stages might affect their decisions

#### Discussion Prompts:
- "In which scenarios does immediate spending make more sense, and why?"
- "How does understanding compound interest change your perspective on everyday spending decisions?"
- "What non-financial factors might influence your decisions beyond the math calculations?"
- "How might your approach to these scenarios change as you get older?"

**Guidance Note**: Emphasize that there are no universally "right" answers to the Time Value of Money Challenge—different people may reasonably make different choices based on their values, preferences, and circumstances. The important thing is making informed decisions with a clear understanding of the financial implications.

### Portfolio Integration & Reflection (5 minutes)

#### Portfolio Completion
- Direct students to the Investment Strategy Template to document their learning
- Explain that this will become part of their financial literacy portfolio
- The portfolio component should include:
  - Key findings from simulator experimentation
  - Their personalized savings plan(s)
  - Decisions and reasoning from the Time Value of Money Challenge
  - A comprehensive strategy for applying compound interest to their future
- Emphasize that this document will be valuable for future financial planning

#### Sharing Insights
- If time permits, ask 2-3 volunteers to share one key insight from today's Learning Lab
- Encourage students to discuss how their understanding of compound interest has evolved
- Ask students to identify one specific action they plan to take based on today's activities
- Highlight a few strong examples of portfolio components as models

#### Closing Message:
"Understanding compound interest and the Rule of 72 gives you a powerful advantage in building your financial future. The decisions you make now—even small ones—can have dramatic effects over time. Whether you're saving for short-term goals or long-term security, these principles can help you make smarter choices and maximize your financial potential. Remember: time is literally money when it comes to compound interest, and starting early—even with small amounts—can make an enormous difference."
