- Play the podcast review that covers:
  - Time horizons and their importance in investment planning
  - Risk tolerance and its impact on investment choices
  - Asset classes and their risk/return profiles
  - Inflation's effect on long-term planning
  - Diversification principles
- After listening, ask 2-3 students to share key concepts they remember from Day 1
- Preview the Learning Lab structure, explaining the stations and final deliverable
- Have students locate their Day 1 work to reference during today's activities

**Facilitation Tip**: If student work from Day 1 is unavailable, have alternative character scenarios ready to provide to students.

### Station 1: Research Zone (10 minutes)

#### Setup & Introduction
- Direct students to the Research Zone station on the Learning Lab page
- Explain that they'll explore different investment vehicles organized by time horizon
- Show them how to navigate the tabbed interface (Short-Term, Medium-Term, Long-Term, Diversification)
- Demonstrate how to take notes on their findings

#### During the Activity
- Encourage students to explore all tabs, not just the one relevant to their scenario
- Remind them to focus on the relationship between time horizon and appropriate vehicles
- Circulate to answer questions about specific investment types
- Check that students are taking useful notes to apply in Station 2

#### Group Sharing
- After individual research time, ask 2-3 students to share an insight about matching investments to time horizons
- Have students briefly discuss how different risk profiles affect investment choices
- Address any misconceptions about investment vehicles before moving to Station 2

#### Key Questions to Pose:
- "Which investment vehicles seem most appropriate for your scenario's time horizon and why?"
- "How does the concept of risk change as the time horizon extends?"
- "What patterns do you notice in the relationship between risk, return, and time horizon?"
- "How do the diversification strategies differ for the three risk profiles?"

### Station 2: Strategy Construction (15 minutes)

#### Setup & Introduction
- Guide students to the Strategy Construction station
- Demonstrate how to select a scenario (or use their Day 1 character)
- Walk through each section of the blueprint:
  - Scenario details
  - Asset allocation sliders
  - Investment vehicle selection
  - Strategy justification fields
- Show an example of a completed strategy to set expectations

#### During the Activity
- This is the most complex station, so circulate actively
- Help students connect their scenario's time horizon to appropriate asset allocation
- Guide students who struggle with asset allocation percentages
- Encourage detailed justifications that reference time horizon, risk tolerance, and inflation
- Remind students that total asset allocation must equal 100%

#### Support Strategies
- For struggling students, suggest starting with the pre-set allocations for their time horizon
- Encourage peer collaboration for students who need additional support
- Have advanced students consider more nuanced allocations based on specific scenario details
- Provide reference materials showing sample allocations for various time horizons

#### Monitoring Points:
- Check that asset allocations align with time horizons (more equities for longer horizons)
- Ensure justifications clearly connect to key concepts from Day 1
- Watch for students using returns as the only criterion rather than considering time horizon and risk
- Provide extended time for this station if needed, as it's the most complex and important

### Station 3: Inflation Calculator (5 minutes)

#### Setup & Introduction
- Direct students to the Inflation Calculator station
- Demonstrate how to use the calculator tools:
  - Entering principal amount
  - Setting time period
  - Adjusting inflation rate
  - Viewing results
- Show how to interpret the visual representation of inflation's impact

#### During the Activity
- Help students connect their scenario's time horizon to appropriate inflation calculations
- Guide them in comparing how different investment returns combat inflation
- Encourage students to write specifically about how inflation impacts their strategy
- Point out the key relationship between investment returns and inflation rates

#### Discussion Prompts:
- "How does inflation change your perspective on your investment strategy?"
- "Why do cash and short-term investments become problematic for long-term goals?"
- "What happens to the 'real return' (after inflation) of your investments?"
- "How much more money will your character need in the future to achieve the same purchasing power?"

**Guidance Note**: Some students may be surprised by inflation's dramatic impact over long periods. Use this as an opportunity to emphasize why growth investments are essential for long-term goals.

### Portfolio Integration & Reflection (15 minutes)

#### Portfolio Completion
- Guide students to the Portfolio Integration section
- Explain that this is where they bring together all components into a cohesive strategy
- Show them how their work from all stations is summarized
- Direct them to complete the portfolio reflection, applying concepts to their own financial goals
- Emphasize the importance of connecting investment principles to personal planning

#### Sharing Insights
- Give students 2-3 minutes to share insights about their strategies with a partner
- Ask 2-3 volunteers to share key takeaways with the whole class
- Highlight especially thoughtful connections between time horizons and strategy choices
- Review common themes in student reflections

#### Closing Message:
Emphasize that investment success rarely comes from picking the "best" investments, but rather from creating strategies that align with specific goals, time horizons, and risk tolerance. The principles learned in this chapter provide a framework for making sound investment decisions throughout their lives, regardless of what specific investment options are available.

## Differentiation Strategies

### For Advanced Students
- Encourage them to create more complex scenarios with multiple financial goals at different time horizons
- Challenge them to calculate the specific rate of return needed to reach goals after accounting for inflation
- Have them research and incorporate more specific investment products in their strategies
- Ask them to compare different diversification approaches and their mathematical impact on portfolio risk
- Suggest they explore how changing economic conditions might affect their strategy

### For Struggling Students
- Provide pre-filled asset allocation templates based on standard time horizons
- Create simplified scenarios with clearer time horizons and goals
- Offer sentence starters for strategy justifications
- Focus on the basic relationship between time horizon and investment choice
- Provide a step-by-step guide for using the inflation calculator
- Partner them with a peer who can provide support

### For ELL Students
- Provide a visual glossary of investment terms with examples
- Use visual aids to reinforce concepts of time horizon, risk, and diversification
- Allow them to work with a partner to discuss concepts in their preferred language
- Provide sentence frames for reflections and justifications

- Accuracy of inflation impact analysis
- Integration of all components into a cohesive strategy
- Application of key concepts from Day 1 (time horizons, risk tolerance, etc.)

#### Success Indicators
- **Excellent Work**: Creates an asset allocation perfectly aligned with the scenario's time horizon; selects appropriate investment vehicles for each asset class; provides detailed, logical justifications that reference key concepts; accurately analyzes inflation's impact; develops a coherent strategy that addresses all required components.
- **Proficient Work**: Creates a reasonable asset allocation for the scenario's time horizon; selects generally appropriate investment vehicles; provides basic justifications that reference some key concepts; includes inflation considerations; develops a functional strategy that addresses most components.
- **Needs Improvement**: Creates an asset allocation misaligned with the scenario's time horizon; selects inappropriate investment vehicles; provides vague or illogical justifications; minimally addresses inflation; develops an incomplete or incoherent strategy.

**Recommendation**: Provide feedback that specifically addresses the alignment between time horizon and asset allocation, as this is the core concept being assessed. For students struggling with this connection, consider a quick one-on-one conference to reinforce the relationship between time horizons and investment choices.
