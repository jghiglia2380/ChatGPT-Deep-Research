#### Setup & Introduction
- Introduce the case studies (tax identity theft and credit card fraud) as real-world examples
- Explain that analyzing actual cases helps develop practical response skills
- Emphasize the importance of both prevention insights and recovery steps
- Remind students to analyze the cases chronologically: how the theft occurred, immediate response, and long-term prevention

#### During the Activity
- Guide students to identify multiple possible sources of personal information theft in each case
- Encourage sequential ordering of recovery steps based on priority and logical flow
- Prompt students to consider both immediate actions and longer-term protection measures
- Help students connect case studies to their own information management practices

#### Group Sharing
