## Detailed Facilitation Notes

### Warm-up & Review (10 minutes)

- Direct students to put on headphones and listen to the pre-recorded podcast reviewing key fraud concepts from Day 1
- The podcast should cover:
  - Different types of consumer fraud (phishing, spoofing, catfishing, identity theft)
  - Common warning signs for each type of fraud
  - Key protection strategies
  - Resources for reporting suspected fraud
- After the podcast, facilitate a brief discussion to reinforce key concepts:
  - Ask 2-3 students to share one key insight they remember from Day 1
  - Address any questions that have arisen since the previous lesson
  - Emphasize connections between yesterday's concepts and today's activities
- Introduce the Learning Lab structure and explain the progression of activities

**Facilitation Tip**: Use this warm-up to identify any misconceptions or gaps in understanding before moving to application activities. Listen carefully to student comments to gauge their level of understanding.

### Activity 1: Analyzing Real-World Scams (15 minutes)

#### Setup & Introduction
- Divide students into groups of 3-4
- Distribute one real-world scam example to each group (ensure diversity of scam types across groups)
- Explain that each group will analyze their assigned scam and create an educational social media post to warn others
- Review the key elements they should identify in their analysis:
  - Type of fraud (phishing, spoofing, etc.)
  - Specific warning signs present in the example
  - Psychological tactics used by the scammer
  - Recommended response if someone receives this scam

#### During the Activity
- Circulate among groups to provide guidance and ask probing questions
- Encourage students to be specific in identifying warning signs
- Guide groups to think about why people might fall for this particular scam
- Ensure students are developing practical, actionable advice for their social media posts
- Prompt groups to consider their target audience and how to make their post engaging

#### Group Sharing
- Have each group briefly present their analysis and social media post concept (1-2 minutes per group)
- Ask other groups to add additional warning signs or insights they notice
- Highlight patterns or common elements across different scam types
- Reinforce effective communication strategies in the social media posts

#### Key Questions to Pose:
- "What makes this scam particularly convincing or dangerous?"
- "Which warning signs might be easy to miss if you're not paying attention?"
- "How would you make your social media post both informative and engaging?"
- "What specific action do you want people to take after seeing your post?"

### Activity 2: Fraud Protection Plan (15 minutes)

#### Setup & Introduction
- Transition students to the Fraud Vulnerability Assessment tool
- Explain that this assessment will help them identify their personal risk areas
- Emphasize that honest self-reflection is essential for accurate results
- Preview the process: assessment → vulnerability profile → action plan development

#### During the Activity
- Guide students through the 10-question digital assessment about online habits and information management
- Have students review their vulnerability profile generated from their responses
- Direct students to the Fraud Protection Plan template where they will:
  - Record their highest vulnerability areas
  - Develop specific action steps to address each vulnerability
  - Identify resources they can use for additional protection
  - Prioritize actions based on risk level and implementation difficulty
- Encourage students to be realistic and specific in their action plans

#### Support Strategies
- For students with high vulnerability scores, provide reassurance and focused guidance
- For students with low vulnerability scores, encourage deeper thinking about subtle risks
- Help students who struggle to identify action steps by suggesting specific protection measures
- Remind students that protection is an ongoing process, not a one-time action

#### Monitoring Points:
- Check that students' plans include specific, actionable steps (not vague goals)
- Ensure students are considering both digital and physical information security
- Watch for unrealistic or overly complex protection strategies
- Note whether students are connecting their vulnerabilities to appropriate protection measures

### Activity 3: Peer Education Challenge (10 minutes)

#### Setup & Introduction
- Introduce the Peer Education Challenge as an opportunity to apply their knowledge
- Explain that effective education is a powerful way to combat fraud
- Ask students to select a specific audience they want to educate about fraud:
  - Family members (parents, grandparents, siblings)
  - Peers (friends, classmates)
  - Community members (younger children, elderly neighbors)
- Have students identify which fraud types their chosen audience is most vulnerable to

#### During the Activity
- Direct students to choose an appropriate format for their educational resource:
  - Social media post or series
  - Short video script
  - Infographic
  - Conversation guide
- Guide students to include in their resource:
  - Information about specific fraud types relevant to the audience
  - Clear warning signs to watch for
  - Practical protection strategies
  - Resources for more information or assistance
- Encourage creativity while maintaining accuracy and clarity

#### Discussion Prompts:
- "Why might this audience be particularly vulnerable to certain types of fraud?"
- "What tone and approach would be most effective for your chosen audience?"
- "How can you make your educational resource memorable and actionable?"
- "What's the most important action you want your audience to take after engaging with your resource?"

**Guidance Note**: Emphasize that effective education is not about making people feel foolish or ignorant but empowering them with knowledge and specific action steps.

### Reflection & Portfolio Submission (5 minutes)

#### Portfolio Completion
- Direct students to the reflection prompt in their digital portfolio
- Remind them that their response should reference their Day 1 reflections
- Encourage students to focus on:
  - Their greatest personal vulnerability to fraud
  - Specific steps they will take to address this vulnerability
  - How they might help educate others about this particular risk
- Explain that this reflection will become part of their financial literacy portfolio

#### Sharing Insights
- If time permits, ask 1-2 volunteers to share brief highlights from their reflection
- Emphasize key takeaways about the importance of ongoing vigilance
- Encourage students to implement their protection plans promptly
- Suggest students share their educational resources with their intended audience

#### Closing Message:
Understanding consumer fraud and how to protect yourself is a critical financial literacy skill that extends far beyond this classroom. The knowledge and strategies you've developed here will help you navigate an increasingly complex digital world and protect your financial future. Remember that fraud protection is not a one-time action but an ongoing practice of awareness and caution. Just as importantly, by educating others, you help create a community that is more resistant to scams and fraud.

## Differentiation Strategies

### For Advanced Students

#### Success Indicators
- **Excellent Work**: Demonstrates sophisticated understanding of fraud types and warning signs; conducts thorough vulnerability self-assessment; develops comprehensive and personalized protection plan with specific, realistic action steps; creates highly effective educational resources tailored to the target audience's needs; provides thoughtful reflection connecting personal experiences to protection strategies.

- **Proficient Work**: Shows accurate understanding of major fraud types; completes vulnerability assessment with reasonable self-awareness; develops adequate protection plan with mostly specific action steps; creates clear educational resources appropriate for the target audience; offers reflection that identifies personal vulnerabilities and basic protection approaches.
