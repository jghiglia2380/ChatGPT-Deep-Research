## Section-by-Section Teaching Notes

### Learning Objectives

#### Teaching Notes
The learning objectives focus on both identification and application of fraud prevention strategies. Begin by emphasizing the prevalence of consumer fraud and its financial impact. Use statistics to demonstrate that this is a relevant issue for students of all ages, not just adults. Frame the lesson as providing practical skills that students can use immediately and throughout their lives.

#### Facilitation Tips
- Ask students to share if they've received suspicious emails or messages to establish relevance
- Present fraud as a problem that affects people of all ages and technological literacy levels
- Clarify that the goal is not to induce fear, but to build confidence through knowledge
- Connect fraud protection to overall financial wellness and security

#### Objective Unpacking
- **Identify different types of consumer fraud**: Key points: Students should recognize the distinct characteristics of phishing, spoofing, catfishing, identity theft, Ponzi schemes, and credit repair scams
- **Recognize warning signs**: Key points: Develop a critical eye for red flags in communications and offers that indicate potential fraud
- **Apply protection strategies**: Key points: Move beyond passive knowledge to active implementation of specific protective measures
- **Understand consumer rights and resources**: Key points: Know what protections exist and where to report suspected fraud
- **Develop skills to educate others**: Key points: Recognize the importance of sharing knowledge to protect vulnerable populations

### Introduction

#### Teaching Notes
The introduction should quickly establish relevance and engagement. Start by asking students about their personal experiences with suspicious messages to create immediate connection to the topic. Share a brief, compelling example of a recent consumer fraud case that affected someone in a demographic similar to your students. Frame the lesson as providing practical "digital self-defense" skills.

#### Facilitation Tips
- Use a quick poll: "Raise your hand if you or someone you know has received a suspicious email, text, or social media message"
- Share a personal anecdote or recent news story about consumer fraud that resonates with students
- Use visual examples of actual scam attempts (with sensitive information redacted)
- Set an inclusive tone that acknowledges varying levels of tech savvy

#### Potential Misconceptions
- "Only elderly people fall for scams" - Highlight that all age groups can be victims, with different scams targeting different demographics
- "I'm too tech-savvy to be fooled" - Emphasize that even cybersecurity experts can be victimized by sophisticated scams
- "If I've been scammed, it's too late to do anything" - Clarify the importance of quick action when fraud is detected

#### Discussion Starters
- "Has anyone ever received an email or text that seemed suspicious? What made you suspicious?"
- "What would you do if you received a message claiming to be from your bank saying your account had been compromised?"
- "Why do you think scammers are often successful despite warnings about their tactics?"

### Key Concepts

#### Teaching Notes
This section introduces the terminology and frameworks for understanding different types of fraud. Present each fraud type with a clear definition and concrete example. Use visual aids where possible to reinforce the characteristics of each type. Emphasize the common psychological tactics used across different fraud types (urgency, fear, greed, trust) to help students develop pattern recognition.

#### Facilitation Tips
- Present fraud types in order of those most likely to be encountered by students first
- Use real examples when possible (with identifying information removed)
- For each type, emphasize both how to identify it and why it works psychologically
- Have students articulate the warning signs they observe in each example

#### Concept Deep Dives
- **Phishing**
  - Elaboration: Show example of fake bank email with suspicious URL. Point out telltale signs (generic greeting, urgent language, unusual sender address)
  - Common confusion: Students may not realize phishing can occur via text message, social media, and phone calls, not just email

- **Spoofing**
  - Elaboration: Demonstrate how caller ID can be falsified to appear as legitimate organizations
  - Common confusion: Students often don't understand the technical ease with which contact information can be falsified

- **Catfishing**
  - Elaboration: Discuss creation of fake personas on social media for financial gain or exploitation
  - Common confusion: Many think catfishing is only related to dating but fail to recognize its financial dimensions

- **Identity Theft**
  - Elaboration: Explain how personal information is used to open accounts or make purchases in the victim's name
  - Common confusion: Students may not understand the connection between other scams and identity theft

- **Ponzi Schemes and Credit Repair Scams**
  - Elaboration: Provide context on how these more complex scams operate and target vulnerable individuals
  - Common confusion: Students may not recognize the warning signs of "too good to be true" investment or credit opportunities

#### Comprehension Check Questions
- "What distinguishes phishing from other types of fraud?"
- "How could you determine if a caller claiming to be from your bank is legitimate?"
- "What are three common warning signs that an email might be fraudulent?"

### Real-World Scenarios

#### Teaching Notes
This section moves from conceptual understanding to applied analysis. The three scenarios (email phishing, text message spoofing, and social media catfishing) provide concrete examples for students to analyze. The small group format encourages collaborative problem-solving and allows students to learn from each other's insights. Your role is to facilitate this analysis and ensure all groups identify the key warning signs and appropriate responses.

#### Facilitation Tips
- Divide students into groups of 3-4 for optimal participation
- Assign each group one of the scenarios to analyze in depth
- Provide a structured analysis framework (type of fraud, warning signs, appropriate response, potential consequences)
- Encourage groups to be specific about why certain elements are suspicious
- Circulate among groups to provide guidance and clarification

#### Discussion Questions
- "What specific elements make this message suspicious?"
- "Why might someone fall for this type of scam despite the warning signs?"
- "What should the person in this scenario do next?"
- "How could the scammer have made this attempt more convincing?"

#### Teaching Challenges & Solutions
- **Challenge**: Students may oversimplify the ease of identifying scams
  - **Solution**: Provide increasingly sophisticated examples that demonstrate how scammers evolve their tactics
- **Challenge**: Some students may have limited exposure to financial systems targeted by scammers
  - **Solution**: Provide brief context about how these systems work to help students understand the scams

#### Subsection: Group Presentations
- Have each group briefly present their analysis to the class (1-2 minutes per group)
- After each presentation, ask if other students have additional warning signs or response strategies to suggest
- Highlight any significant warning signs or protection strategies they may have missed
- Use this as an opportunity to emphasize common elements across different scam types

### Fraud Prevention Strategies

#### Teaching Notes
This section transitions from identification to action, focusing on what students can do to protect themselves. The four main strategies provide a comprehensive framework: Know Your Rights, Secure Your Information, Verify Sources, and Report Suspicious Activity. For each strategy, provide concrete, actionable steps that students can implement immediately. Emphasize that protection is an ongoing process, not a one-time action.

#### Facilitation Tips
- Present each strategy with specific action steps, not just general advice
- Provide examples of how each strategy prevents different types of fraud
- Ask students to contribute additional tactics for each strategy
- Connect strategies to the specific scams analyzed in the previous section

#### Example Analysis
- **Know Your Rights**
  - Key points to emphasize: Free annual credit reports, credit freezes, and resources for reporting fraud
  - Discussion questions: "Why is it important to check your credit report regularly? What might you look for?"

- **Secure Your Information**
  - Key points to emphasize: Strong password practices, two-factor authentication, social media privacy settings
  - Discussion questions: "What makes a password strong? How often should you update passwords for financial accounts?"

- **Verify Sources**
  - Key points to emphasize: Contacting companies directly through official channels, researching investment opportunities
  - Discussion questions: "If you receive a suspicious email claiming to be from your bank, what steps should you take to verify it?"

- **Report Suspicious Activity**
  - Key points to emphasize: Immediate reporting to financial institutions, FTC reporting process
  - Discussion questions: "Why is quick reporting important if you suspect fraud? What agencies handle fraud complaints?"

#### Extension Activity
Ask students to create a personal "security audit" checklist of 5-7 specific actions they will take in the next week to improve their fraud protection (e.g., enable two-factor authentication on important accounts, check privacy settings on social media, etc.).

### Skill Builder Activity

#### Activity Overview
The Phishing Recognition Video Skill Builder is the cornerstone of Day 1 content and connects directly to Day 2 learning activities. This hands-on application helps students see phishing attempts through the lens of interpersonal communication about online safety, which is particularly effective for teaching digital literacy skills.

**Key Connection**: This Skill Builder specifically connects to the Day 2 Learning Lab by providing foundational knowledge about phishing that students will build upon when developing their fraud protection plans and educational materials. The reflection on how to educate others prepares students for the Peer Education Challenge in the Learning Lab.

#### Activity Objectives
- Identify specific warning signs of phishing attempts in a realistic context
- Observe effective communication strategies for discussing online safety
- Reflect on personally relevant approaches to educating others
- Apply critical thinking to evaluate suspicious communications

#### Step-by-Step Facilitation
1. **Introduction (1-2 min)**: Explain that the video shows a conversation between friends about a suspicious email
2. **Video Viewing (3-5 min)**: Play the video for the class, ensuring all students can see and hear clearly
3. **Initial Discussion (1-2 min)**: Ask what warning signs were identified in the video and what made them suspicious
4. **Reflection Writing (3-4 min)**: Direct students to write their personal reflections on how they would approach educating others
5. **Sharing & Discussion (2-3 min)**: If time permits, invite 2-3 volunteers to share their approaches
6. **Connection to Day 2 (1 min)**: Explain how their reflections will inform their work in the Learning Lab

#### Common Challenges & Solutions
- **Challenge**: Students may focus solely on technical aspects rather than communication strategies
  - **Solution**: Remind them that effective education requires both technical knowledge and interpersonal skills
- **Challenge**: Some students may struggle to relate to the scenario if they haven't encountered phishing
  - **Solution**: Provide additional context or examples that might be more relevant to their experiences
- **Challenge**: Limited time for meaningful reflection
  - **Solution**: Suggest that students continue thinking about their approaches after class and come prepared for Day 2
- **Challenge**: Some students may be reluctant to share personal stories
  - **Solution**: Offer alternative prompts focused on hypothetical situations

#### Differentiation Strategies
- **For Students Who Need Support**:
  - Provide a structured template for their reflection responses
  - Offer a simplified list of phishing warning signs as reference
  - Allow collaborative discussion before individual writing
  - Provide specific examples of suspicious emails to analyze

- **For Advanced Students**:
  - Challenge them to consider more sophisticated phishing attempts that lack obvious warning signs
  - Ask them to consider how scammers might counter-adapt to increased awareness
  - Encourage research into recent phishing trends and tactics
  - Suggest they develop specific communication strategies for different audiences (elderly relatives, younger siblings)

#### Examples & Models
- **Basic Example**: A reflection that identifies common phishing warning signs and suggests explaining these signs to others in simple terms to help them avoid scams.
- **Exemplary Example**: A nuanced reflection that considers both technical identification skills and effective communication approaches, acknowledges the importance of non-judgmental guidance, and demonstrates understanding of why people fall for scams despite warnings.

#### Connection to Day 2
The Skill Builder activity is directly connected to the Day 2 Learning Lab and serves as essential preparation. Make these connections explicit to students:
- Day 2 will begin with a review of fraud types and warning signs
- The Fraud Vulnerability Assessment will help them personalize their protection strategies
- The Peer Education Challenge builds directly on their reflections about effective ways to educate others
- Their reflections will be imported into the Day 2 activities to provide continuity

**Important**: Ensure students understand that their reflections should be thoughtful and specific, as they will serve as building blocks for tomorrow's activities. The focus on educating others is a key element that will carry through to Day 2.

#### Assessment Guidance
When reviewing student work on the Skill Builder activity, look for:
- Specific identification of phishing warning signs from the video
- Thoughtful reflection on personal communication approaches
- Consideration of the audience's perspective and potential concerns
- Balance between technical information and supportive communication
- Practical, implementable strategies for education

**Assessment Note**: This Skill Builder is a formative assessment opportunity. Provide feedback that helps students develop their communication strategies for the Day 2 Peer Education Challenge.

**Feedback Approach**: When providing feedback, focus on one strength ("I appreciate your sensitivity to not making others feel foolish") and one area for growth ("Consider adding specific examples of warning signs to make your explanation more concrete").

### Conclusion

#### Teaching Notes
The conclusion serves to reinforce key takeaways and prepare students for the next day's learning lab. Keep this section brief but impactful, emphasizing that knowledge of scam tactics is their best defense. The preview of Day 2 activities helps students understand how today's learning will be applied and extended tomorrow.

#### Facilitation Tips
- Recap the four main fraud prevention strategies
- Highlight the most important warning signs across different fraud types
- Emphasize the importance of immediate action if fraud is suspected

## Discussion Prompts

### For Introduction:
"Have you or someone you know ever received a suspicious email, text, or social media message? What made it seem suspicious?"
**Expected responses**: Requests for personal information, grammatical errors, urgent tone, unexpected contact, strange email addresses, too-good-to-be-true offers

### For Key Concepts:
"Why do you think phishing attempts often create a sense of urgency in their messages?"
**Expected responses**: To prevent careful thinking, to bypass rational analysis, to make people act quickly without verifying, to create panic that clouds judgment

### For Fraud Prevention:
"Besides what we've discussed, what are some additional ways you could protect your personal information online?"
**Expected responses**: Using a password manager, checking website security certificates, reading privacy policies, using private browsing mode, limiting information shared on social media, using VPN services
