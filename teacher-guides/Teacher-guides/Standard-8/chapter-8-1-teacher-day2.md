## Detailed Facilitation Notes

### Warm-up & Review (10 minutes)

- Welcome students and explain that today's Learning Lab will focus on applying the credit card concepts they learned in Day 1
- Direct students to listen to the podcast review which covers:
  - The difference between credit cards and debit cards
  - How interest is calculated and accrues on unpaid balances
  - The importance of the grace period for avoiding interest
  - Key strategies for responsible credit card use
  - Common credit card pitfalls to avoid
- After the podcast, facilitate a brief discussion to check understanding:
  - "What's one important point you remember from yesterday's lesson?"
  - "Which credit card concept do you find most confusing?"
  - "What questions do you still have about credit cards?"
- Address any misconceptions before moving to the next activity

**Facilitation Tip**: If some students finish the podcast review early, have them begin thinking about which scenario from Day 1 (Sarah's success or John's challenges) was more impactful to them and why. This keeps them engaged while waiting for others to finish.

### Credit Card Interest Calculator (15 minutes)

#### Setup & Introduction
- Direct students to the interactive Credit Card Interest Calculator tool
- Explain that this activity will help them visualize the true cost of carrying a credit card balance
- Demonstrate the tool by working through an example:
  - Starting balance: $2,000
  - APR: 18%
  - Monthly payment: Minimum payment (around $40)
  - Show that it would take over 9 years to pay off and cost about $2,200 in interest
- Point out key features of the calculator:
  - Input fields for balance, APR, and payment amount
  - Results showing months to pay off and total interest
  - Graph showing balance reduction over time

#### During the Activity
- Assign students to complete the following scenarios:
  1. **Scenario 1**: Calculate how long it would take to pay off $1,500 at 15% APR paying $75 monthly
  2. **Scenario 2**: Calculate the total interest paid on a $3,000 balance at 20% APR if paid off in 12 months
  3. **Scenario 3**: Have students create their own scenario based on a purchase they might make in the future
- For each scenario, have students record:
  - The number of months to pay off the balance
  - The total interest paid
  - The total cost of the purchase (original amount + interest)
- Encourage students to experiment with different payment amounts to see how increasing payments reduces both payoff time and total interest

#### Support Strategies
- For students who struggle with the calculator, provide a guided worksheet with step-by-step instructions
- For students who quickly understand the basic scenarios, challenge them to determine how much they would need to pay monthly to clear a $5,000 balance in exactly 24 months
- Circulate to check calculations and provide assistance as needed

#### Monitoring Points:
- Ensure students understand the relationship between payment amount and payoff time
- Check that students are drawing appropriate conclusions from their calculations
- Look for students who might be surprised by the results, as this indicates important learning moments
- Listen for comments that reveal misconceptions about interest or minimum payments

**Specific Questions to Pose to Students:**
- "What happens to the total interest paid when you increase the monthly payment amount?"
- "If you had a $2,000 balance at 18% APR, how much extra would you pay in interest if you only made minimum payments?"
- "How much faster could you pay off a credit card balance if you increased your payment by just $50 per month?"
- "What does this calculator tell you about the strategy of making only minimum payments?"

### Credit Card Decision-Making Scenarios (15 minutes)

#### Setup & Introduction
- Introduce the Credit Card Decision-Making Scenarios activity
- Explain that students will apply their knowledge to realistic situations they might face
- Emphasize that there may be multiple appropriate responses depending on individual circumstances
- Review the format: scenario description, multiple options to choose from, and justification for choices

#### During the Activity
- Guide students through the following types of scenarios:
  
  **Scenario 1: Store Credit Card Offer**
  *You're buying a new laptop for $800 and the cashier offers 15% off your purchase if you apply for their store credit card. The card has a 24.99% APR and no annual fee.*
  Options:
  - Apply for the card, get the discount, and pay off the balance immediately
  - Apply for the card, get the discount, and pay over 3 months
  - Decline the card and pay the full amount with debit/cash
  - Decline the card but ask about other available discounts
  
  **Scenario 2: Credit Limit Management**
  *You have a credit card with a $1,500 limit. Your balance is currently $1,200 and you want to make a $500 purchase.*
  Options:
  - Make the purchase anyway, exceeding your limit
  - Pay down your balance first, then make the purchase
  - Use a different payment method for this purchase
  - Call your credit card company to request a credit limit increase
  
  **Scenario 3: Credit Card Selection**
  *You're applying for your first credit card. Which of these would be your top priority?*
  Options:
  - A card with the lowest possible APR
  - A card with the best rewards program
  - A card with no annual fee
  - A card from your current bank
  
- For each scenario, instruct students to:
  1. Select the option they think is best
  2. Write a justification for their choice
  3. Explain potential consequences of the other options

#### Discussion Prompts:
- "When might a store credit card offer be worth considering, and when should you decline?"
- "What factors should you consider before requesting a credit limit increase?"
- "How might your priorities for a credit card change over time?"
- "What information would you need to make a better decision in these scenarios?"

**Guidance Note**: Emphasize that context matters in these scenarios. A decision that's right for one person might be wrong for another based on their financial situation, goals, and habits. The key is making informed decisions rather than impulsive ones.

### My Credit Card Management Plan (10 minutes)

#### Setup & Introduction
- Introduce the Credit Card Management Plan activity as the culmination of what they've learned

  1. Card selection criteria
  2. Spending tracking method
  3. Payment strategy
  4. Pitfall avoidance techniques
- If appropriate, remind students to reference their Day 1 Skill Builder responses about card selection

#### During the Activity
- Guide students to develop their plans section by section:
  
  **1. Card Selection Criteria**
  - What features are most important to you in a credit card?
  - How would your spending habits influence your card choice?
  - What APR range would you consider acceptable?
  - Would you be willing to pay an annual fee? Under what circumstances?
  
  **2. Spending Tracking Method**
  - How will you monitor your credit card charges?
  - What tools or apps might you use to track spending?
  - How frequently will you check your balance?
  - What spending limits might you set for different categories?
  
  **3. Payment Strategy**
  - How much of your balance will you aim to pay each month?
  - Will you set up automatic payments? For what amount?
  - What will be your strategy if you can't pay the full balance?
  - How will you ensure you never miss a payment deadline?
  
  **4. Pitfall Avoidance Techniques**
  - How will you avoid common credit card mistakes?
  - What will you do if you're tempted to overspend?
  - How will you protect yourself from fraud?
  - What's your emergency plan if you face financial hardship?

- Encourage students to be specific and realistic in their plans
- Remind them that the best plan is one they'll actually follow

#### Integration Questions:
- "How does your plan reflect what you learned from the interest calculator activity?"
- "Which of the decision-making scenarios influenced your pitfall avoidance strategies?"
- "How might your plan change as your financial situation evolves?"
- "What specific actions will you take in the first month of having a credit card?"

### Reflection & Wrap-up (5 minutes)

#### Portfolio Completion
- Direct students to review their completed credit card management plans
- Ask them to highlight the one strategy they believe will be most important for their success
- Have them write a brief commitment statement at the end of their plan

#### Sharing Insights
- Invite 2-3 volunteers to share one key element from their credit card management plans
- Ask students to complete this exit ticket: "The most important thing I learned about credit cards is..."
- Share a final thought about how these skills will benefit them throughout their financial lives
- Connect this learning to future financial topics (like loans, mortgages, or investing)

#### Closing Message:
Credit cards are powerful financial tools that can either help you build credit and manage purchases conveniently or lead to costly debt if misused. The knowledge and skills you've developed over these two days will help you make informed decisions about credit cards now and in the future. Remember that the most successful credit card users have a clear plan, consistently follow responsible practices, and understand the true cost of carrying balances. By applying what you've learned, you'll be well-positioned to use credit cards as a tool for building financial strength rather than a source of financial stress.
