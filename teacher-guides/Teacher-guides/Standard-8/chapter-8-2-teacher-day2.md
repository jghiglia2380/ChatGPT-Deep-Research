## Detailed Facilitation Notes

### Warm-up & Podcast Review (10 minutes)

- Begin by orienting students to the Learning Lab structure and activities
- Play the podcast that reviews key concepts from Day 1:
  - Benefits and risks of online shopping
  - Security measures before, during, and after purchase
  - Identifying secure websites and payment methods
  - Real-world examples of positive and negative experiences
- Have students note new insights or information while listening
- After the podcast, facilitate brief discussion using reflection prompts:
  - "What key point about online shopping security resonated with you?"
  - "Which risk do you think is most concerning, and why?"
  - "What strategy do you think is most effective for protection?"

**Facilitation Tip**: Use the podcast discussion to address any misconceptions or gaps in understanding from Day 1. This helps ensure all students have the necessary foundation for today's activities.

### Activity 1: Safe Shopping Simulator (10 minutes)

#### Setup & Introduction
- Direct students to the Safe Shopping Simulator in the Learning Lab
- Explain that they'll navigate through realistic scenarios and make decisions about website security
- Emphasize that the simulation compresses time and presents multiple potential scenarios
- Point out that they'll receive immediate feedback on their choices
- Remind students to look for security indicators discussed in Day 1 (https, padlock icon, etc.)

#### During the Activity
- Circulate to observe student decision-making and provide guidance as needed
- Encourage students to verbalize their reasoning as they evaluate website features
- Point out commonly missed security features if you notice patterns
- Remind students to consider all security elements, not just the obvious ones
- For students who finish early, suggest they try the simulation again to improve their score

#### Group Sharing
- After most students have completed the simulation, briefly discuss:
  - Common security features that were easy to identify
  - Less obvious security indicators that were frequently missed
  - Surprising elements that students didn't realize were security concerns
- Create a quick class list of "Top 5 Security Red Flags" based on the simulation experience

#### Key Questions to Pose:
- "Which security indicators were easiest to spot in the simulation?"
- "What security features might you have overlooked before this activity?"
- "How realistic did you find these scenarios compared to your own online shopping experiences?"
- "What was the most surprising thing you learned from the simulation?"

### Activity 2: Price Comparison Research Project (12 minutes)

#### Setup & Introduction
- Guide students to the Price Comparison Research activity
- Explain that thorough product research across multiple retailers is a key component of smart online shopping
- Suggest product categories appropriate for the activity (headphones, sneakers, backpacks, etc.)
- Review all factors to consider beyond just price:
  - Base price
  - Shipping costs
  - Estimated delivery time
  - Tax
  - Return policy
  - Warranty information
  - Customer reviews
  - Website security features
  - Special offers or discounts

#### During the Activity
- Help students select appropriate products for their research
- Remind them to document all costs including shipping and taxes
- Encourage consideration of multiple factors, not just price
- Suggest examining 3-4 different retailers for comparison
- Remind students to note security features of each retailer website

#### Support Strategies
- For students struggling to choose a product, provide suggestions or allow them to work in pairs
- Direct students to specific retailers if they're unsure where to start
- Provide a structured comparison template for students who need additional organization
- Remind students of the Day 1 Skill Builder format as a model for comparison

#### Monitoring Points:
- Check that students are documenting all relevant factors
- Ensure students are calculating total costs including shipping and taxes
- Observe whether students are considering security features of retailer websites
- Look for evidence that students are evaluating customer reviews critically
- Note if students are making connections to concepts from Day 1

### Activity 3: Secure Checkout Analysis (8 minutes)

#### Setup & Introduction
- Direct students to the Secure Checkout Analysis activity
- Explain that they'll be examining different checkout processes to identify security features
- Review the security feature checklist that students will use:
  - HTTPS/Padlock icon
  - Clear privacy policy
  - Multiple payment options
  - No requests for unnecessary information
  - Secure payment badges/certifications
  - Order review page
  - Confirmation email
  - Clear contact information
- Emphasize that even small details can indicate potential security concerns

#### During the Activity
- Help students navigate through the example checkout pages
- Draw attention to security features that might be overlooked
- Remind students to complete the security checklist for each example
- Guide students in ranking the checkout processes from most to least secure
- Connect observations to the "during purchase" security measures from Day 1

#### Discussion Prompts:
- "Why might some sites request unnecessary information during checkout?"
- "How does the presence of multiple payment options contribute to security?"
- "What security features do you think are absolute requirements vs. 'nice to have'?"
- "What would you do if you encountered a checkout page missing several security features?"

**Guidance Note**: Help students understand the difference between security features (which protect their information) and usability features (which make the process easier but don't necessarily enhance security). Both are important but serve different purposes.

### Activity 4: Digital Consumer Rights Guide (5 minutes)

#### Setup & Introduction
- Introduce the Digital Consumer Rights Guide activity
- Explain that understanding consumer rights is an essential part of safe online shopping
- Review the key areas that should be included in their guide:
  - Return and refund rights
  - Fraud protection and liability limits
  - Shipping and delivery guarantees
  - Data privacy rights
  - Dispute resolution processes
  - Reporting agencies for problems
- Provide access to the resource database with consumer protection information

#### During the Activity
- Help students organize their guides in a logical, accessible format
- Suggest focusing on rights specifically relevant to online shopping
- Encourage students to include practical actions to take when rights are violated
- Remind students to make their guides user-friendly for future reference
- Suggest personalizing the guide based on their own shopping habits

#### Discussion Prompts:
- "Which consumer protection surprised you the most?"
- "How might knowing these rights change your approach to online shopping?"
- "In what situation might you need to reference these rights?"
- "What's the most important thing consumers should know about their online shopping rights?"

### Activity 5: Smart Shopping Plan (Portfolio Project) (8 minutes)

#### Portfolio Completion
- Direct students to the Smart Shopping Plan activity
- Explain that this will bring together all their learning into a personalized strategy
- Point out that this plan should incorporate:
  - Personal security checklist before making purchases
  - Preferred payment methods with rationale
  - Research strategy for vetting retailers and products
  - Record-keeping system for purchases
  - Plan for handling order issues
  - List of trusted retailers with justification
  - Guidelines for choosing online vs. in-store shopping
- Remind students to refer to their Day 1 Skill Builder responses when developing their plan
- Encourage practical, realistic strategies they'll actually use

#### Sharing Insights
- Ask 2-3 volunteers to share one key element of their shopping plan
- Highlight diverse approaches that reflect different priorities
- Acknowledge that effective plans will vary based on individual shopping habits
- Emphasize that plans should evolve as technology and shopping platforms change

#### Closing Message:
As online shopping continues to evolve, the fundamental principles of security and informed decision-making remain constant. Your personal Smart Shopping Plan is a living document that should adapt as you gain experience and as technologies change. By implementing these strategies consistently, you can enjoy the convenience of online shopping while minimizing the risks. Remember that even small security measures, when applied consistently, significantly reduce your vulnerability to fraud and identity theft.
