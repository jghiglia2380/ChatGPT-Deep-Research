## Section-by-Section Teaching Notes

### Learning Objectives

#### Teaching Notes
Begin by connecting to students' experiences with online shopping. Ask for a show of hands of who has shopped online before. Emphasize that the lesson will build on existing knowledge while introducing important security concepts.

#### Facilitation Tips
- Frame the lesson as practical life skills rather than abstract concepts
- Emphasize that even savvy digital natives can be vulnerable to sophisticated scams
- Connect to current events related to data breaches or online shopping trends
- Show growth statistics of e-commerce to highlight the relevance of these skills

#### Objective Unpacking
- **Identify benefits and risks of online shopping**: Key points: Balance of convenience vs. security concerns
- **Evaluate security of retailers and payment methods**: Key points: Specific security indicators to look for
- **Apply strategies to protect information**: Key points: Proactive steps before, during, and after purchases
- **Compare online and in-store options**: Key points: Different factors to consider beyond just price

### Key Concepts & Online Shopping Landscape

#### Teaching Notes
This section establishes essential vocabulary and provides an overview of the online shopping environment. As you introduce key terms, provide concrete examples that students can relate to. When discussing the benefits and risks, encourage students to share their own experiences.

#### Facilitation Tips
- Create a visual T-chart of benefits vs. risks that you fill in with student contributions
- Use actual screenshots of shopping platforms familiar to students
- When explaining technical terms like "encryption," use simple analogies
- Have students rank benefits and risks based on what they find most significant

#### Concept Deep Dives
- **E-commerce**
  - Elaboration: Highlight the rapid growth and evolving nature of online retail
  - Common confusion: Many students don't recognize specialty e-commerce platforms as part of the broader concept

- **Digital wallet**
  - Elaboration: Explain different types including platform-specific (Apple Pay, Google Pay) vs. universal (PayPal)
  - Common confusion: Students may not understand the security advantages of digital wallets over direct card entry

- **Encryption**
  - Elaboration: Use the analogy of a locked box that only the intended recipient can open
  - Common confusion: Students often don't connect the "https" and padlock icon to actual security measures

#### Comprehension Check Questions
- "What are three benefits of online shopping that you personally value most?"
- "Which of the risks we discussed concerns you the most when shopping online?"
- "How can you tell if a website is using encryption to protect your information?"

### Protecting Yourself When Shopping Online

#### Teaching Notes
This section provides practical strategies students can immediately apply when shopping online. Structure the discussion around the three phases of online shopping: before, during, and after purchase. For each phase, explain specific security measures and demonstrate them when possible.

#### Facilitation Tips
- Use actual websites (both secure and potentially problematic) to demonstrate security features
- Create a student-friendly checklist of security measures that they can reference
- Consider role-playing a safe online purchase, talking through each security check
- Show students how to check a website's security credentials in real-time

#### Discussion Questions
- "Why is it generally safer to use credit cards rather than debit cards when shopping online?"
- "What information might a legitimate retailer need vs. information that should raise red flags?"
- "How could you verify if an unfamiliar online store is trustworthy?"

#### Teaching Challenges & Solutions
- **Challenge**: Students may believe they're already knowledgeable enough about online safety
  - **Solution**: Present recent, sophisticated scams that have affected even tech-savvy users
- **Challenge**: Abstract security concepts can be difficult to grasp
  - **Solution**: Use visual demonstrations and concrete examples for each security measure

#### Subsection: Secure Payment Methods
When discussing payment methods, emphasize the different levels of protection offered. Create a simple ranking of payment methods from most to least secure, explaining the protections offered by each:
1. Credit cards (strongest consumer protections, limited liability)
2. Digital wallets/payment services (added layer of protection, don't share actual card numbers)
3. Debit cards (direct access to bank accounts, fewer protections)
4. Bank transfers (difficult to reverse)
5. Cryptocurrency, wire transfers, gift cards (virtually no protection)

### Real-World Examples

#### Teaching Notes
The three case studies (Jenna, Mike, and Thomas) provide concrete scenarios that illustrate key concepts. Present each example and guide students in analyzing what went well or poorly in each situation. Connect each example back to the security strategies previously discussed.

#### Facilitation Tips
- Ask students to identify specific risks or protective measures in each example
- Have students suggest alternative actions the characters could have taken
- Connect examples to the "before, during, and after" framework
- Consider adding a fourth, locally relevant example if appropriate

#### Example Analysis
- **Jenna's Experience (Positive)**
  - Key points to emphasize: Research before purchase, price comparison, verification of security, record-keeping
  - Discussion questions: "What specific steps did Jenna take to ensure a safe purchase?"

- **Mike's Mistake (Negative)**
  - Key points to emphasize: Red flag of dramatically lower price, lack of research, importance of dispute processes
  - Discussion questions: "What warning signs did Mike ignore? How could he have protected himself?"

- **Thomas Takes Precautions (Protective)**
  - Key points to emphasize: Proactive security measures, preparation for potential issues
  - Discussion questions: "Which of Thomas's precautions do you think was most important? Why?"

#### Extension Activity
If time permits, have students create their own "fourth example" of an online shopping scenario that demonstrates good security practices. This can be based on their own experiences or created as a hypothetical situation.

### Guided Practice: Scenario Analysis

#### Teaching Notes
This small group activity allows students to apply their learning to new scenarios. Prepare 3-4 different scenarios that present various online shopping situations requiring analysis of potential risks and appropriate actions.

#### Facilitation Tips
- Keep groups small (2-3 students) to ensure active participation
- Provide clear time limits (3-4 minutes) for analysis
- Circulate to guide groups that may be missing key considerations
- Select diverse scenarios that illustrate different aspects of online shopping security

#### Example Scenarios
1. "You receive an email offering a limited-time 70% discount on a popular electronics brand. The email has the company logo but directs you to an unfamiliar website."
2. "You're buying concert tickets online and notice the website doesn't have 'https' in the URL, but the tickets are selling out quickly."
3. "You purchase an item online and receive a confirmation, but three weeks later it hasn't arrived. The order status says 'shipped' but doesn't provide tracking information."

Have each group identify:
- Potential risks in the scenario
- Red flags or warning signs
- Recommended actions to take
- Alternative approaches if applicable

### Skill Builder Activity

#### Activity Overview
The Online vs. In-Store Purchase Analysis is the cornerstone of Day 1 content and connects directly to Day 2 learning activities. This hands-on application helps students develop critical thinking skills about different shopping methods.

**Key Connection**: This Skill Builder specifically connects to the Day 2 Learning Lab by establishing a framework for evaluating shopping options that students will apply in the Price Comparison Research Project and Smart Shopping Plan activities.

#### Activity Objectives
- Compare online and in-store shopping options across multiple factors
- Evaluate the importance of different factors based on personal priorities
- Recognize that the "best" shopping method depends on individual circumstances
- Practice making evidence-based consumer decisions

#### Step-by-Step Facilitation
1. **Introduction (2-3 min)**: Explain that there's no universally "better" way to shop—the best choice depends on the product, personal preferences, and priorities
2. **Instructions & Examples (3-5 min)**: Display the comparison table and walk through each factor to consider (price, convenience, selection, etc.)
3. **Individual Work (5-8 min)**: Have students complete the analysis for a laptop purchase, considering both online and in-store options
4. **Progress Check (1-2 min)**: Ask a few quick questions to ensure students are considering multiple factors
5. **Continued Work (2-3 min)**: Have students complete their preferred option and justification
6. **Sharing & Discussion (3-5 min)**: Have volunteers share their decisions and reasoning
7. **Connection to Day 2 (1-2 min)**: Preview how this analysis framework will be used in tomorrow's Learning Lab

#### Common Challenges & Solutions
- **Challenge**: Students focus only on price without considering other factors
  - **Solution**: Prompt with specific examples of when convenience, security, or return policy might outweigh price
- **Challenge**: Limited personal experience with different shopping methods
  - **Solution**: Suggest students think about family members' experiences or consider hypothetical scenarios
- **Challenge**: Oversimplified "online is always cheaper" assumptions
  - **Solution**: Discuss hidden costs like shipping, and potential in-store price matching
- **Challenge**: Difficulty weighing multiple factors
  - **Solution**: Suggest students rank factors by personal importance before making a final decision

#### Differentiation Strategies
- **For Students Who Need Support**:
  - Provide a partially completed example to model the analysis process
  - Offer a simplified version with fewer factors to consider
  - Allow verbal responses instead of written analysis
  - Pair students to discuss factors before individual completion

- **For Advanced Students**:
  - Add complexity by considering hybrid options (buy online, pick up in store)
  - Challenge them to create decision trees for different types of products
  - Have them research and add additional factors not listed
  - Ask them to analyze how their decision might change for international purchases

#### Examples & Models
- **Basic Example**: A student determines in-store shopping is better for a laptop because they want to test the keyboard and screen before buying, and immediate availability is important to them.
- **Exemplary Example**: A student provides detailed analysis of each factor with specific examples (e.g., "Online price is $899 with free shipping vs. in-store price of $949 plus tax"), weighs the importance of each factor based on personal needs, and explains how their decision would change under different circumstances.

#### Connection to Day 2
The Skill Builder activity is directly connected to the Day 2 Learning Lab and serves as essential preparation. Make these connections explicit to students:
- Day 2, Activity 2 (Price Comparison Research) will expand on the comparison framework
- Day 2, Activity 5 (Smart Shopping Plan) will incorporate personal preferences identified today
- The security concerns noted today will be addressed in the Safe Shopping Simulator

**Important**: Ensure students save their Skill Builder work, as they will reference their comparative analysis during tomorrow's Learning Lab activities.

#### Assessment Guidance
When reviewing student work on the Skill Builder activity, look for:
- Consideration of multiple factors beyond just price
- Thoughtful analysis of strengths/weaknesses of each shopping method
- Personal reflection on which factors matter most to them
- Logical connection between analysis and final decision
- Recognition that different products might warrant different shopping methods

**Assessment Note**: This Skill Builder is a formative assessment opportunity. Look for evidence that students understand the multi-faceted nature of shopping decisions rather than simplistic "right or wrong" conclusions.

**Feedback Approach**: When providing feedback, focus on one strength ("I like how you considered the security trade-offs") and one area for growth ("Next time, consider how the return policy might affect your decision").

## Conclusion and Next Steps
