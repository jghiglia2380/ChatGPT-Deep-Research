**Facilitation Tip**: If time is limited, you can assign the podcast as pre-class homework and focus the first 5 minutes on discussing key takeaways.

### Activity 1: Retirement Calculator Introduction (8 minutes)

#### Setup & Introduction
- Direct students to the retirement calculator portion of the Learning Lab
- Demonstrate the calculator on the main screen with a sample scenario:
  - Current age: 18
  - Retirement age: 65
  - Life expectancy: 90
  - Starting amount: $0
  - Monthly contribution: $200
  - Expected return: 7%
  - Expected inflation: 2.5%
- Explain each input and how it affects the calculation
- Show how small changes in contributions or retirement age significantly impact outcomes
- Explain the difference between nominal and inflation-adjusted results

#### During the Activity
- Have students input their own information based on their envisioned retirement lifestyle
- Guide them to test at least three different scenarios by changing:
  - Monthly contribution amounts
  - Retirement ages
  - Expected return rates
- Encourage them to note the differences between scenarios
- Circulate to assist students who are struggling with the calculator
- Point out key insights such as the impact of starting early or increasing contributions slightly

#### Support Strategies
- For students who finish quickly, suggest testing more extreme scenarios
- For students who struggle, provide a worksheet with pre-defined scenarios to test
- Point out the visual graph showing growth over time for visual learners
- Connect calculator results to the 50/30/20 rule from Day 1's Skill Builder

#### Monitoring Points:
- Check that students understand the exponential nature of long-term investing
- Ensure they're using realistic return assumptions (not too optimistic or pessimistic)
- Watch for students who may be overwhelmed by the numbers and offer support
- Note any common patterns in student approaches for discussion

### Activity 2: Account Comparison Analysis (12 minutes)

#### Setup & Introduction
- Direct students to the account comparison tool
- Review the key retirement accounts they'll be analyzing:
  - 401(k)/403(b)
  - Traditional IRA
  - Roth IRA
  - Health Savings Account (HSA)
  - Taxable Investment Account
- Explain the difference between tax-deferred, tax-free, and taxable accounts
- Clarify contribution limits and employer matching concepts
- Demonstrate how to complete the comparison worksheet

#### During the Activity
- Have students complete the account comparison worksheet by researching each account type
- Emphasize these key comparison points:
  - Tax benefits (contributions and withdrawals)
  - Contribution limits
  - Withdrawal rules and penalties
  - Required minimum distributions (RMDs)
  - Ideal usage scenarios
- Encourage students to add personal notes about which accounts might be most relevant to them
- Have students rank the accounts based on their personal situation and goals

#### Group Sharing
- After 8-10 minutes of individual work, have students briefly discuss their findings with a partner
- Ask for volunteers to share insights about specific account types
- Facilitate a discussion about situations where one account might be preferable to another
- Address common misconceptions about retirement accounts:
  - Clarify that Roth vs. Traditional depends on current vs. future tax rates
  - Explain that employer matches are essentially "free money"
  - Note that HSAs have triple tax advantages for those who qualify

#### Key Questions to Pose:
- "Why might someone choose a Roth IRA over a Traditional IRA?"
- "How does an employer match affect your decision-making about 401(k) contributions?"
- "When would it make sense to contribute to a taxable account instead of a retirement account?"
- "How might your current career plans affect which retirement accounts you'll have access to?"

### Activity 3: Personalized Retirement Strategy Builder (15 minutes)

#### Setup & Introduction
- Direct students to the Retirement Strategy Builder tool
- Explain that they'll be creating a comprehensive retirement plan based on:
  - Their envisioned retirement lifestyle from Day 1's reflection
  - The calculator results from today
  - Their account comparison analysis
- Show the key components of a comprehensive retirement strategy:
  - Retirement lifestyle goals and estimated expenses
  - Target retirement age and time horizon
  - Savings rate and account allocation
  - Risk tolerance and investment approach
  - Adjustment strategies for different life stages

#### During the Activity
- Guide students through the step-by-step process of creating their strategy:
  1. Define retirement lifestyle goals and estimated monthly expenses
  2. Set target retirement age and calculate time horizon
  3. Determine appropriate savings rate based on calculator results
  4. Select specific retirement accounts and allocation percentages
  5. Define investment approach based on risk tolerance and time horizon
  6. Create a timeline with key milestones and adjustment triggers

- For students who are uncertain about their future, suggest developing multiple scenarios

#### Monitoring Points:
- Ensure students are connecting their strategy to their personal goals
- Check that savings rates are realistic given likely starting salaries
- Make sure risk approaches align with their time horizons
- Verify that students understand the tax implications of their account choices

### Reflection & Wrap-up (10 minutes)

#### Peer Feedback
- Pair students to review each other's retirement strategies
- Provide a structured feedback form with prompts:
  - "Is the savings rate realistic based on the income projection?"
  - "Does the investment approach match the time horizon?"
  - "Are the account choices appropriate for the stated goals?"
  - "What strengths do you see in this strategy?"
  - "What suggestions would you make to improve this strategy?"
- Allow 3-4 minutes for each review
- Have students document the feedback they receive

#### Strategy Refinement
- Give students 2-3 minutes to revise their strategies based on peer feedback
- Encourage students to note any significant changes they made
- Have a few volunteers share one insight they gained from peer feedback

#### Closing Message:
Retirement planning might seem distant at your age, but the financial decisions you make now can significantly impact your future security and options. The power of compound growth means that starting early—even with small amounts—can lead to substantial benefits over time. Your personalized strategy isn't set in stone; it will evolve as your life changes. The key is to start thinking strategically about your long-term financial future and to make conscious choices that align with your goals.

#### Final Reflections
- Ask students to respond to this final prompt: "What is one action you could take in the next year to begin implementing your retirement strategy?"
- Collect responses either verbally or in writing
- Preview how this learning connects to future financial planning topics

## Differentiation Strategies

### For Advanced Students

- Ask them to research and incorporate more advanced concepts like tax-loss harvesting or Roth conversion ladders
- Encourage them to develop multiple retirement scenarios (early retirement, traditional retirement, part-time work in retirement)
- Have them calculate the exact monthly contribution needed to reach a specific retirement goal

### For Struggling Students
- Provide simplified calculator templates with fewer variables
- Offer a basic retirement strategy template with more structure and guidance
- Create a visual flowchart to guide retirement account selection
- Reduce the number of accounts to compare initially
- Allow partner work for more complex calculations
- Provide real-world examples with clear explanations

### For ELL Students
