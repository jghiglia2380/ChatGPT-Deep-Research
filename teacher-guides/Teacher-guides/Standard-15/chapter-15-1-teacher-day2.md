# Learning Lab Teacher Guide: Chapter 15.1: Career Exploration and Goal Setting

## Learning Lab Overview

**Standard:** Standard 15: Career Readiness
**Chapter:** 15.1: Career Exploration and Goal Setting
**Duration:** 55 minutes
**Focus:** Applying career planning concepts through interactive stations that develop comprehensive career plans
**Format:** Multiple station activities culminating in a portfolio project

This Learning Lab extends students' understanding from Day 1 into practical application through a series of interactive stations. Students will create visual career timelines, analyze potential obstacles, design accountability systems, and integrate financial considerations into their career plans.

## Detailed Facilitation Notes

### Warm-up & Review (5 minutes)

- Begin by referencing the Career Path Planner work from Day 1, reminding students of the key components:
  - Multiple timeframes (short-term, mid-term, long-term)
  - Multiple categories (education, experience, skills, networking)
  - SMART goal framework
- Explain the Learning Lab structure and how each station builds on their initial career planning work
- Emphasize that today's activities will transform their initial plans into comprehensive career development portfolios
- Preview the peer review process that will occur after students complete all stations
- Clarify that students should bring their Career Path Planner work to each station

**Facilitation Tip**: Create a visual map of the Learning Lab journey on the board, showing how each station contributes to the final portfolio. This helps students understand the connections between activities.

### Station 1: Career Path Timeline Development (10 minutes)

#### Setup & Introduction
- Provide Career Timeline Templates (printed or digital)
- Display examples of completed timelines showing different career paths
- Explain that students will create visual representations of their career paths with key milestones
- Emphasize the importance of connecting related milestones to show progression

#### During the Activity
- Encourage students to include specific dates/years for key milestones
- Remind them to address all four categories from their Career Path Planner
- Suggest using color-coding to distinguish different types of activities (education, experience, skills, networking)
- Prompt students to draw connection lines between related milestones
- Circulate to check that timelines align with SMART goals from Day 1

#### Group Sharing
- Have volunteers briefly share one aspect of their timeline that they're excited about
- Ask students to identify the connections between different milestones
- Discuss how visualization helps with long-term planning

#### Key Questions to Pose:
- "How did creating a visual timeline help you think differently about your career plan?"
- "Which milestones seem most critical to reaching your long-term goals?"
- "What connections did you discover between different aspects of your career development?"
- "How might your timeline need to adjust if circumstances change?"

- Provide sentence starters for solution development
- Offer examples of how successful professionals overcame similar obstacles

#### Monitoring Points:
- Check that obstacles are specific and realistic rather than vague

  - Starting salaries in target fields
  - Salary progression throughout career timeline
  - Benefits and non-salary compensation
  - Geographic factors affecting both costs and income
- Help students create rough estimates of costs and potential earnings

#### Closing Message:
Career planning is not a one-time event but an ongoing process that will evolve throughout your life. The framework and tools you've developed in these sessions will serve as valuable resources as you navigate your career journey. Remember that plans may change as you gain new experiences and insights—that's not a failure of planning but a natural part of growth and development. The most important outcome is not a perfect plan but the development of a strategic mindset for approaching career decisions.

## Summative Assessment Guide

### Learning Lab Deliverable: Career Development Portfolio

#### Assessment Criteria
- Thoroughness of career planning across all timeframes and categories
- Integration of SMART goal principles throughout the plan
- Quality of obstacle analysis and solution development
- Practicality of accountability system design
- Depth of financial considerations and integration
- Responsiveness to peer feedback
- Overall presentation and organization

#### Success Indicators
- **Excellent Work**: Creates a comprehensive career development portfolio with detailed, logically connected components across all timeframes. Timeline shows clear progression with specific milestones. Obstacle analysis includes insightful identification of challenges with multiple viable solutions. Accountability system is personalized, detailed, and practical. Financial integration demonstrates thorough understanding of education costs, funding options, and income projections. All components are cohesively integrated with thoughtful reflection on the planning process.

- **Proficient Work**: Develops a complete career development portfolio with adequate coverage of timeframes and categories. Timeline includes basic milestones with some connections. Obstacle analysis identifies relevant challenges with reasonable solutions. Accountability system includes core tracking components. Financial integration considers major costs and income factors. Components are generally connected with some reflection on the process.

- **Needs Improvement**: Presents an incomplete career development portfolio with gaps in timeframes or categories. Timeline lacks specificity or logical progression. Obstacle analysis is superficial with limited solution development. Accountability system is basic or impractical. Financial integration is minimal or unrealistic. Components appear disconnected with little reflection on the process.

**Recommendation**: Evaluate portfolios based on both content quality and the thought process demonstrated. The goal is not for all students to have identical career paths but for each student to engage meaningfully with the career planning process in a way that's relevant to their individual circumstances and aspirations.
