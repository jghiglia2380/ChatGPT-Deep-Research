## Section-by-Section Teaching Notes

### Learning Objectives

#### Teaching Notes
Begin by emphasizing the personal relevance of career exploration for students. Connect career planning to their future financial well-being and life satisfaction. Explain that while they may have jobs now or in the near future, this lesson focuses on longer-term career planning. Frame the learning objectives as practical life skills they'll use repeatedly throughout their lives.

#### Facilitation Tips
- Ask students about their current thoughts on potential careers to gauge initial interest and knowledge
- Use a brief poll to identify how many students have specific career plans already versus those who are undecided
- Emphasize that career planning is an ongoing process, not a one-time decision
- Connect to previous lessons on financial goal setting, showing how career and financial planning interrelate

#### Objective Unpacking
- **Understand the difference between a job and a career**: Key points: Jobs are specific positions for earning income while careers are long-term professional journeys involving growth and development.
- **Identify personal interests, skills, and values**: Key points: Self-assessment provides the foundation for fulfilling career choices.
- **Research career paths using appropriate resources**: Key points: Reliable information sources lead to informed career decisions.
- **Develop SMART career goals**: Key points: Effective goals are specific, measurable, achievable, relevant, and time-bound.
- **Create a personalized career development plan**: Key points: A good plan includes education, experience, skills development, and networking components.

### Introduction

#### Teaching Notes
The introduction should establish the critical difference between jobs and careers. Use relatable examples that resonate with high school students' experiences and aspirations. Emphasize that while jobs provide immediate income, careers offer long-term growth, satisfaction, and typically greater financial rewards. Use visual aids to illustrate the progression from entry-level positions to advanced career stages.

#### Facilitation Tips
- Start with a relatable scenario: "Imagine it's five years from now, and you're deciding between two opportunities..."
- Use examples of well-known professionals who have had notable career progressions
- Display a simple table comparing job characteristics (short-term, task-focused) with career characteristics (progression, skill development)
- Ask students to share examples of jobs versus careers from their own observations

#### Potential Misconceptions
- Careers always require a college degree
- Career paths are linear and unchangeable
- Career exploration is only needed once
- The highest-paying career is automatically the best choice
- All careers require similar planning approaches

#### Discussion Starters
- "What's the difference between someone who 'has a job' versus someone who 'has a career'?"
- "How might someone's approach to work differ if they view it as a career rather than just a job?"
- "Why is it valuable to start career planning in high school?"

### Key Concepts

#### Teaching Notes
This section introduces fundamental vocabulary and frameworks for career exploration. Present the three-part self-assessment process (interests, skills, values) as the foundation for all career exploration. Provide clear explanations and examples for each component, emphasizing how they contribute to career satisfaction and success. Use visual aids to illustrate the relationships between these components.

#### Facilitation Tips
- Have students jot down initial thoughts about their interests, skills, and values before formal assessment
- Create a mind map showing the interconnections between interests, skills, and values
- Use examples of how misalignment between personal characteristics and career choices can lead to dissatisfaction
- Provide real-world examples of how people's interests and skills translated into successful careers

#### Concept Deep Dives
- **Interests Assessment**
  - Elaboration: Help students distinguish between casual interests and deeper interests that could translate to careers. Guide them to consider subjects they enjoy learning about, activities they lose track of time doing, and topics they naturally read/watch content about.
  - Common confusion: Students often struggle to connect interests to potential careers or dismiss interests as not "serious" enough for careers.

- **Skills Inventory**
  - Elaboration: Explain the difference between hard skills (technical, teachable abilities) and soft skills (interpersonal, transferable abilities). Have students consider skills they've developed in school, extracurricular activities, volunteering, and personal projects.
  - Common confusion: Students frequently underestimate their skills or fail to recognize transferable skills they've already developed.

- **Values Clarification**
  - Elaboration: Discuss how work values (such as autonomy, creativity, security, recognition, helping others) impact career satisfaction. Guide students to reflect on what matters most to them in a work environment.
  - Common confusion: Students may not have consciously considered their work values or may be influenced by others' values rather than their own.

#### Comprehension Check Questions
- "How might someone with an interest in technology but a value of helping others find a career that satisfies both?"
- "What's the difference between a hard skill and a soft skill? Give an example of each."
- "Why is understanding your own values important when exploring careers?"

### Deeper Exploration

#### Teaching Notes
This section builds on self-assessment by introducing career research resources and SMART goal setting. Walk students through the process of using reliable career information sources, emphasizing the importance of data-driven decision making. Then transition to translating research into concrete goals using the SMART framework. Provide structured guidance for each step in the research and goal-setting process.

#### Facilitation Tips
- Demonstrate actual use of career research websites with real-time searches based on student interests
- Create a comparison of reliable versus unreliable career information sources
- Use a think-aloud approach to model the thought process for researching a specific career
- Provide before/after examples of vague goals transformed into SMART goals

#### Discussion Questions
- "What aspects of a career would be most important for you to research before making decisions?"
- "How might setting SMART goals help you make progress in career development?"
- "What challenges might you face when researching careers, and how would you overcome them?"

#### Teaching Challenges & Solutions
- **Challenge**: Students focus only on careers they're already familiar with
  - **Solution**: Introduce career clusters and have students explore at least one unfamiliar occupation within clusters matching their interests
- **Challenge**: Students set unrealistic or vague career goals
  - **Solution**: Provide guided practice with the SMART framework, with peer feedback on specificity and measurability

#### Subsection: Career Exploration Resources
- Walk students through the key features of major career resources:
  - O*NET: Comprehensive database of occupations with detailed skill requirements
  - BLS Occupational Outlook Handbook: Salary data, job outlook, education requirements
  - CareerOneStop: Videos, local information, and training requirements
- Demonstrate how to compare information across sources
- Show how to extract relevant details for career planning

#### Subsection: SMART Career Goals
- Explain each component of SMART with career-specific examples:
  - Specific: "Become a registered nurse specializing in pediatrics" vs. "Work in healthcare"
  - Measurable: "Complete an internship with at least 120 hours of experience" vs. "Get some experience"
  - Achievable: Realistic based on circumstances, abilities, and resources
  - Relevant: Aligned with interests, skills, values, and broader life goals
  - Time-bound: "By the end of my sophomore year of college" vs. "Someday"
- Guide students through transforming general career aspirations into SMART goals

### Real-World Examples

#### Teaching Notes
This section grounds abstract concepts in concrete career development stories. Present detailed case studies that illustrate different pathways and approaches to career planning. These examples should demonstrate how real people navigate the career exploration process, set goals, overcome obstacles, and adjust plans over time. Use diverse examples that represent various education levels, fields, and career progression patterns.

#### Facilitation Tips
- Select examples relevant to a range of student interests and backgrounds
- Highlight both traditional and non-traditional career paths
- Use visual timelines to illustrate career progression in each example
- Emphasize how career plans often evolve and adapt over time

#### Example Analysis
- **Sarah's Healthcare Journey**
  - Key points to emphasize: How she used volunteer experiences to confirm her interest in healthcare, researched different roles before choosing nursing, set specific educational goals, and built relevant experience incrementally
  - Discussion questions: "What evidence of SMART goal setting do you see in Sarah's story? How did her early experiences inform her later career decisions?"

- **Miguel's Tech Career Exploration**
  - Key points to emphasize: How he developed technical skills through self-directed learning, built a portfolio through projects, networked with professionals, and adjusted his timeline based on financial considerations
  - Discussion questions: "How did Miguel's approach differ from Sarah's? What role did networking play in his career development?"

#### Extension Activity
Have students identify someone whose career they admire and research that person's career pathway, noting education, key experiences, skills developed, and apparent goal-setting patterns.

### Summary

### Skill Builder Activity

#### Activity Overview
The Career Path Planner is the cornerstone of Day 1 content and connects directly to Day 2 learning activities. This interactive planning tool helps students translate their self-assessment insights and career research into a structured development plan with short-term, mid-term, and long-term components.

**Key Connection**: This Skill Builder specifically connects to the Day 2 Learning Lab by establishing the basic structure of a career development plan that will be expanded and refined through the Learning Lab stations. The initial plan created here will be directly built upon during the Learning Lab activities.

#### Activity Objectives
- Create a structured career development plan with multiple time horizons
- Identify specific goals for education, experience, skills, and networking
- Connect career planning to personal interests, skills, and values
- Establish a foundation for more detailed planning in the Day 2 Learning Lab
- Practice using the SMART goal framework in career contexts

#### Step-by-Step Facilitation
1. **Introduction (2-3 min)**: Explain the Career Path Planner structure and how it organizes career development across four categories and three time periods.
2. **Instructions & Demo (3-5 min)**: Walk through an example plan, showing how to create SMART goals for each category and time period.
3. **Individual Work (5-8 min)**: Have students begin developing their own plans, starting with identifying a career direction and setting short-term goals.
4. **Progress Check (1-2 min)**: Check that students understand the process and address any common questions or issues.
5. **Continued Work (5-8 min)**: Guide students to develop mid-term and long-term goals, ensuring they consider all four categories.
6. **Sharing & Discussion (3-5 min)**: Have volunteers share elements of their plans and discuss how they connect to personal interests, skills, and values.
7. **Connection to Day 2 (1-2 min)**: Preview how students will expand their plans in the Day 2 Learning Lab through more detailed activities.

#### Common Challenges & Solutions
- **Challenge**: Students struggle to identify a career direction
  - **Solution**: Suggest focusing on broader career clusters initially or creating alternative plans for different possibilities
- **Challenge**: Goals lack specificity or measurability
  - **Solution**: Provide sentence starters for each SMART component and check individual work with guiding questions
- **Challenge**: Students focus too heavily on education, neglecting experience, skills, and networking
  - **Solution**: Require at least one goal for each category and provide examples of non-educational career development activities
- **Challenge**: Wide variation in completion time
  - **Solution**: Have extension activities for quick finishers, such as researching specific requirements for their identified career path

#### Differentiation Strategies
- **For Students Who Need Support**:
  - Provide partially completed examples they can adapt
  - Offer a more structured template with guiding questions for each section
  - Focus on short-term planning first, adding mid and long-term goals as time permits
  - Pair with a peer who can provide feedback and suggestions

- **For Advanced Students**:
  - Encourage research on specific certifications, programs, or experiences for their chosen field
  - Challenge them to create alternate pathways to their career goals
  - Have them incorporate financial planning aspects, such as education costs and anticipated income
  - Suggest creating more detailed sub-goals within each category

#### Examples & Models
- **Basic Example**: A student identifies interest in marketing, sets education goals for relevant coursework and degree, experience goals for internships, skill goals for social media and design software, and networking goals for joining professional groups.
- **Exemplary Example**: A student creates a detailed plan for a psychology career with multiple pathway options (clinical, research, industrial-organizational), specific milestone achievements, detailed skill development sequence, and clear connections between short-term activities and long-term aspirations.

#### Connection to Day 2
The Career Path Planner skill builder is directly connected to the Day 2 Learning Lab and serves as essential preparation. Make these connections explicit to students:
- Day 2, Station 1 (Career Path Timeline) will build on the timeframes and milestones identified in the skill builder
