- Clarify that each student should spend approximately 5 minutes as interviewer and 5 minutes as interviewee

#### During the Activity
- Circulate among pairs to monitor progress and provide guidance
- Listen for appropriate use of the STAR method and specific examples
- Remind students to use the feedback form to provide constructive peer evaluation
- Encourage genuine but supportive feedback that identifies both strengths and areas for improvement

#### Group Sharing
- After both partners have interviewed, have them complete feedback forms
- Encourage pairs to share the most valuable feedback they received
- Ask 1-2 volunteers to share a particularly effective response with the whole group

#### Key Questions to Pose:
- "What was the most challenging aspect of responding to behavioral questions?"
- "How did using the STAR method help structure your responses?"
- "What specific feedback did you receive that will help you improve your interview skills?"
- "How did this experience differ from using the Interview Simulator in Day 1?"

### Station 2: Workplace Professionalism Scenarios (10 minutes)

#### Setup & Introduction
- Organize students into small groups of 3-4
- Distribute scenario cards with workplace situations requiring professional judgment
- Provide the Professional Workplace Expectations Framework handout
- Explain that groups should analyze scenarios using the framework and determine appropriate responses

#### During the Activity
- Ensure groups are identifying the relevant workplace expectations for each scenario
- Guide discussions toward thoughtful analysis rather than superficial responses
- Encourage students to consider multiple perspectives in complex scenarios
- Remind students to prepare for the role-play component after their discussion

#### Support Strategies
- For groups struggling with analysis, suggest they focus on 1-2 key expectations first
- Provide prompting questions: "How might reliability apply in this situation?" or "What does accountability look like here?"
- For advanced groups, challenge them to identify tensions between different professional expectations
- Encourage concrete, specific response strategies rather than general advice

#### Monitoring Points:
- Check that groups are completing the "Your Response Plan" section with actionable strategies
- Listen for evidence that students are connecting scenarios to workplace expectations
- Ensure groups are preparing both professional and unprofessional approaches for role-play
- Monitor time to ensure groups move from discussion to role-play preparation

### Station 3: Professional Communication Workshop (15 minutes)

#### Setup & Introduction
- Arrange four mini-stations focused on different professional communication contexts:
  1. Email Station: Professional email composition
  2. Virtual Meeting Station: Video conferencing best practices
  3. Conflict Resolution Station: Using "I" statements effectively
  4. Professional Introduction Station: Crafting a 30-second introduction
- Direct students to spend about 3-4 minutes at each mini-station
- Provide clear instructions for rotation between mini-stations

#### During the Activity
- Keep time and announce rotations between mini-stations
- At the Email Station, check that students are using appropriate subject lines, greetings, and professional language
- At the Virtual Meeting Station, ensure students are evaluating the setup examples correctly and identifying key elements of professional presence
- At the Conflict Resolution Station, verify students are correctly reformulating statements using the "I" statement format
- At the Professional Introduction Station, listen for complete elements (name, role, experience, connection point)

#### Discussion Prompts:
- "How does professional communication differ across these contexts?"
- "Which communication context feels most challenging to you and why?"
- "How might adapting your communication style to different contexts benefit you professionally?"
- "What patterns did you notice across all professional communication contexts?"

**Guidance Note**: The Professional Communication Workshop is intentionally fast-paced to expose students to multiple contexts. Encourage them to make notes about techniques they want to develop further after class. The goal is exposure to different formats rather than mastery of all four in this limited time.
