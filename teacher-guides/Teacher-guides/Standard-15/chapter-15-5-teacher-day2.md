## Detailed Facilitation Notes

### Warm-up: Side Hustle Brainstorm (5 minutes)

- Begin by briefly recapping the key concepts from Day 1, including the entrepreneurial mindset, types of side hustles, and business planning basics
- Have students retrieve their Business Plan Builder worksheets from Day 1 to use as a foundation
- For students who missed Day 1, provide a quick overview and simplified template to get them started
- Organize a brief think-pair-share activity where students share their business ideas with a partner and receive initial feedback
- Guide students to select one business idea to develop throughout the Learning Lab activities

**Facilitation Tip**: Create an energetic atmosphere that encourages creativity and openness. Remind students that the goal is practical learning, not creating a perfect business plan. Acknowledge that entrepreneurship involves continuous refinement of ideas.

### Activity 1: Business Concept Development (10 minutes)

#### Setup & Introduction
- Explain that a clear business concept and value proposition are foundational to any business plan
- Introduce the Business Concept Worksheet and walk through the key components:
  - Business description
  - Problem/need being addressed
  - Solution offered
  - Target customer
  - Unique selling proposition
  - Business name and branding elements
- Display the example business concept from the student content (mobile pet grooming service) to illustrate a well-defined concept

#### During the Activity
- Have students work individually to refine their business concepts from Day 1
- Encourage specificity and clarity, especially regarding what problem they're solving and for whom
- Prompt students to create a compelling value proposition that clearly communicates their unique benefits
- Guide students to develop a business name that reflects their offering and appeals to their target market
- Circulate to provide feedback and ask probing questions that help students clarify their concepts

#### Group Sharing
- After individual work time, have students share their business concept with a small group (3-4 students)
- Structure the feedback process with specific prompts:
  - Is the business concept clear and specific?
  - Is the value proposition compelling?
  - Does the business name effectively reflect the concept?
  - What potential challenges might this business face?
- Encourage constructive feedback that helps students strengthen their concepts

#### Key Questions to Pose:
- "How does your solution address a specific pain point for your target customers?"
- "What makes your business concept different from existing alternatives?"
- "Is your value proposition specific enough that customers would understand your offering?"
- "Does your business name effectively communicate what you do?"

- Provide specific timeframes for each major section to ensure progress (e.g., 3 minutes per section)
- Circulate to provide guidance, particularly for sections students find challenging
- Offer specific examples and models for different sections
- Encourage students to check for consistency across sections (e.g., do marketing strategies align with target customer profiles?)
- Prompt regular review and refinement of previous sections

#### Discussion Prompts:
- "How do your marketing strategies specifically address the needs and behaviors of your target customers?"
- "What operational challenges might you face, and how would you address them?"
- "What skill gaps might exist in your management approach, and how could you fill them?"
- "How does your business description connect to your overall value proposition?"

**Guidance Note**: This activity forms the core of the Learning Lab. While students may not complete every section in full detail, emphasize that they should develop enough substance in each section to create a cohesive plan. Encourage them to note areas where they would need additional research or expertise.

### Activity 4: Financial Projections Workshop (10 minutes)

#### Discussion Prompts:
- "What startup costs might be specific to your business that wouldn't apply to others?"
- "How did you arrive at your sales projections, and what evidence supports those estimates?"
- "What factors influenced your pricing strategy beyond just covering costs?"
- "How long might it take to reach profitability based on your projections?"

**Guidance Note**: Many students will be tempted to underestimate costs and overestimate revenue. Gently challenge assumptions and encourage research-based projections. Emphasize that realistic financial planning is more valuable than optimistic forecasts.

  3. What did you learn about yourself as a potential entrepreneur?
  4. How might you apply these business planning skills in other aspects of your life?
- Allow a few volunteers to share insights from their reflections

#### Closing Message:
Today you've experienced the process of developing a comprehensive business plan for an entrepreneurial venture. Whether or not you decide to pursue entrepreneurship immediately, the skills you've practicedâ€”identifying opportunities, conducting market research, planning operations, projecting finances, and pitching ideasâ€”are valuable in many contexts. Even if you work within established organizations, entrepreneurial thinking can help you innovate, solve problems, and create value. Remember that most successful entrepreneurs started with simple ideas and refined them based on feedback and experience.
