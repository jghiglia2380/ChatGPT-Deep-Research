## Detailed Facilitation Notes

### Warm-up & Review (5 minutes)

- Begin by having students take out their resume drafts from Day 1
- Ask students to review their own work, considering:
  - Completeness of all essential sections
  - Use of action verbs and quantified achievements
  - Formatting consistency and professionalism
  - Tailoring to target industry or position
- Have students make note of 2-3 areas they feel could be strengthened
- Introduce the day's focus on peer review, revision, and digital brand extension
- Explain the workshop structure and expectations for each activity

**Facilitation Tip**: Create a positive feedback environment by discussing the value of constructive criticism in professional development. Emphasize that peer review is not about criticism but about helping each other improve.

### Common Resume Mistakes (10 minutes)

- Present key resume mistakes to avoid through examples and discussion:
  - Typos and grammatical errors
  - Inconsistent formatting (fonts, spacing, alignment)
  - Vague language without specific examples
  - Inappropriate length (too long or too short)
  - Missing or unprofessional contact information
  - Generic one-size-fits-all approach
  - Focusing on responsibilities instead of achievements

- Show before-and-after examples of resume sections that demonstrate:
  - Weak vs. strong action verbs
  - Vague duties vs. quantified achievements
  - Inconsistent vs. clean formatting
  - Generic vs. tailored content

- Engage students in identifying issues in sample resumes:
  - Display a resume with multiple common mistakes
  - Have students work in pairs to identify as many issues as possible
  - Discuss findings as a class
  - Show the corrected version

- Connect to peer review activity:
  - Explain that students will use their knowledge of common mistakes to provide helpful feedback
  - Emphasize looking for both strengths to reinforce and opportunities for improvement
  - Remind students that identifying issues in others' work helps sharpen awareness of our own blind spots

**Facilitation Tip**: When showing resume mistakes, use realistic but fictional examples rather than potentially embarrassing real student work. Present the analysis of mistakes as a problem-solving opportunity rather than criticism.

### Activity 1: Resume Peer Review Stations (15 minutes)

#### Setup & Introduction
- Organize students into groups of 3-4 for peer review
- Distribute Resume Peer Review worksheets to each student
- Review the peer feedback protocol:
  - Focus on being specific and constructive
  - Balance positive feedback with suggestions for improvement
  - Refer to specific resume sections and elements
  - Use the criteria checklist (content, clarity, formatting, language, impact)
- Demonstrate effective feedback statements:
  - "Your experience bullets start with strong action verbs like 'coordinated' and 'implemented'"
  - "Your education section could be strengthened by adding relevant coursework"
  - "The inconsistent spacing between sections makes it harder to scan quickly"

#### During the Activity
- Set timer for approximately 4-5 minutes per resume review
- Circulate among groups to facilitate productive discussion
- Listen for quality of feedback and redirect if necessary
- Encourage students to be specific about both strengths and areas for improvement
- Prompt deeper analysis with questions like:
  - "What impression would this make in the first 30 seconds?"
  - "How effectively does this showcase the person's qualifications?"
  - "What stands out most positively about this resume?"
  - "Which section would benefit most from revision?"

#### Group Sharing
- After all resumes have been reviewed, facilitate a brief whole-class discussion
- Ask each group to share one valuable insight from the peer review process
- Discuss common themes in feedback across groups
- Highlight particularly effective feedback approaches observed
- Transition to the revision activity by emphasizing the importance of implementing feedback

#### Key Questions to Pose:
- "What was the most helpful piece of feedback you received about your resume?"

- "How might this peer review process mirror professional feedback in the workplace?"
- "Why is getting multiple perspectives valuable when developing professional materials?"

### Activity 2: Resume Revision Workshop (10 minutes)

#### Setup & Introduction
- Direct students to return to their own resumes with the feedback they've received
- Instruct them to prioritize 3-5 specific improvements to implement
- Suggest they focus on high-impact changes first:
  - Strengthening weak bullet points with better action verbs
  - Adding quantifiable achievements
  - Improving formatting consistency
  - Addressing any gaps or weak areas identified
- Remind students that this is about targeted improvement, not complete overhaul

#### During the Activity
- Have students work independently on their revisions
- Provide access to resources such as:
  - Action verb lists categorized by skill type
  - Examples of quantified achievements
  - Formatting guidelines and templates
  - Industry-specific resume examples
- Circulate to provide individual assistance and answer questions
- Encourage students to implement the most critical feedback first

- For advanced students:
  - Challenge them to create alternate versions for different positions
  - Suggest development of complementary documents (cover letter, references)
  - Encourage deeper customization for specific industries

#### Monitoring Points:

- Ensure revisions address the feedback received rather than unrelated changes
- Watch for students who may be resistant to implementing feedback
- Note common areas of confusion or difficulty to address in future lessons

### Activity 3: Digital Presence Audit (10 minutes)
