## Section-by-Section Teaching Notes

### Learning Objectives

#### Teaching Notes
Begin by clearly stating the learning objectives and explaining why resume building and personal branding are critical skills for career success. Emphasize that these are practical skills students will use repeatedly throughout their careers. Connect the objectives to students' future goals and explain how today's learning will help them stand out in competitive job markets.

#### Facilitation Tips
- Ask students about their current understanding of resumes to gauge prior knowledge
- Connect to students' career aspirations to increase engagement and relevancy
- Share a brief personal anecdote about how a well-crafted resume or personal brand helped in your professional journey
- Use visual aids showing the dramatic difference between effective and ineffective resumes

#### Objective Unpacking
- **Identify the essential components of an effective resume**: Key points: Students should recognize the standard resume sections and understand what makes each section effective.
- **Recognize the importance of personal branding**: Key points: Students should understand how personal branding influences career opportunities and professional perception.
- **Develop strategies for highlighting skills and experiences**: Key points: Students should learn techniques for presenting their background effectively using action verbs and quantifiable achievements.
- **Understand how to tailor resumes**: Key points: Students should recognize the importance of customizing resumes for specific opportunities rather than using a one-size-fits-all approach.
- **Create a framework for a personal brand**: Key points: Students should identify key elements of their unique professional identity to develop a consistent brand.

### Introduction

#### Teaching Notes
Start by establishing the purpose and importance of resumes as personal marketing documents. Discuss how resumes serve as a first impression for employers and how a strong resume can open doors to interviews. Introduce the concept of personal branding as a related skill that extends beyond the resume to encompass one's professional identity.

#### Facilitation Tips
- Use polling or raised hands to assess student familiarity with resume writing
- Share statistics about resume screening (e.g., average time recruiters spend reviewing resumes)
- Show a brief video about the importance of first impressions in professional contexts
- Invite students to share their perceptions or experiences with resumes

#### Potential Misconceptions
- "Resumes should include all my work and educational experiences"
- "One resume works for all job applications"
- "Personal branding is only for influencers or entrepreneurs"
- "I don't have enough experience for a good resume"
- "The most creative resume design will get me noticed"

#### Discussion Starters
- "What do you think is the main purpose of a resume in the job application process?"
- "How might employers use resumes to screen candidates?"
- "Why might personal branding be important for career development?"
- "How do you think the role of resumes has changed with the rise of digital job applications?"

### Key Components of a Resume

#### Teaching Notes
Walk through each essential resume section, explaining its purpose and best practices. Use visual examples of well-constructed sections to illustrate key points. Emphasize that different career fields may have slightly different expectations for resume formats, but these core components remain consistent.

#### Facilitation Tips
- Display a sample resume and point out each component as you discuss it
- Provide both exemplary and poor examples of each section
- Ask students to identify what makes the exemplary examples effective
- Use color-coding or visual highlighting to emphasize key elements

#### Concept Deep Dives
- **Contact Information**
  - Elaboration: Explain the importance of professional email addresses and the optional inclusion of LinkedIn profiles or personal websites. Discuss what contact information is appropriate (name, phone, email, location) versus inappropriate (birthdate, marital status, photo).
  - Common confusion: Students often use unprofessional email addresses or include too much personal information.

- **Professional Summary/Objective**
  - Elaboration: Explain how this section serves as a targeted introduction showcasing key qualifications. Discuss the difference between a summary (for those with experience) and an objective (for those with limited experience).
  - Common confusion: Students often write vague, generic summaries or objectives that don't highlight their unique value.

- **Education Section**
  - Elaboration: Discuss how to format education depending on experience level. For students and recent graduates, education typically comes before experience, with more detail on relevant coursework, honors, etc.
  - Common confusion: Students sometimes omit important details like academic honors or relevant coursework, or include unnecessary information like high school education once they're in college.

- **Experience Section**
  - Elaboration: Emphasize the importance of action verbs, measurable achievements, and relevance. Explain that experience can include internships, volunteer work, campus leadership, and class projects, not just paid employment.
  - Common confusion: Students often simply list job duties rather than achievements, or don't recognize how transferable skills from various experiences apply to target positions.

- **Skills Section**
  - Elaboration: Discuss how to categorize skills (technical, language, soft skills) and the importance of matching skills to job requirements. Explain the difference between listing skills and demonstrating them through experience descriptions.
  - Common confusion: Students often include vague skills like "hard worker" instead of specific, verifiable skills, or fail to provide context for skill proficiency.

#### Comprehension Check Questions
- "Which resume section would be most appropriate for highlighting your proficiency with specific software programs?"
- "Why is it important to include metrics or quantifiable achievements in your experience descriptions?"
- "How might the education section differ between a recent graduate and someone with 10 years of work experience?"
- "What contact information is essential for a resume, and what should be omitted?"

### Resume Best Practices & Examples

#### Teaching Notes
Focus on techniques that strengthen resume content and presentation. Emphasize the use of action verbs, quantification of achievements, concise formatting, consistency, and tailoring. Use before-and-after examples to illustrate how these practices transform mediocre resume content into compelling descriptions.

#### Facilitation Tips
- Distribute action verb lists categorized by skill type (leadership, communication, analysis, etc.)
- Display weak bullet points and have students suggest improvements using action verbs
- Show examples of quantified achievements and discuss what makes them effective
- Present a job description and demonstrate how to tailor a resume to match it

#### Discussion Questions
- "Why do you think action verbs create a stronger impression than passive language?"
- "How can you quantify achievements for experiences where numbers might not be obvious?"
- "What aspects of formatting make a resume easy to scan quickly?"
- "What elements of a job description should you look for when tailoring your resume?"

#### Teaching Challenges & Solutions
- **Challenge**: Students with limited work experience struggle to identify content for their resumes
  - **Solution**: Emphasize that class projects, volunteer work, extracurricular activities, and even relevant coursework can demonstrate valuable skills
- **Challenge**: Students have difficulty quantifying achievements
  - **Solution**: Provide a framework for different types of quantification (percentages, numbers, frequencies, scales) and work through examples as a class

#### Subsection: Using Action Verbs
Focus on the power of strong action verbs to demonstrate initiative and impact. Provide examples of weak statements transformed with strong verbs: 
- Weak: "Was responsible for customer service"  
- Strong: "Resolved customer concerns and improved satisfaction ratings by 15%"

Distribute action verb lists categorized by skill type and have students practice transforming weak statements into strong ones.

#### Subsection: Quantifying Achievements
Demonstrate different methods of quantification:
- Numerical: "Trained 15 new employees on company procedures"
- Percentage: "Increased attendance at events by 35% through targeted marketing"
- Frequency: "Processed an average of 40 transactions daily with 99% accuracy"
- Scale: "Managed a $50,000 budget for student organization events"

Have students brainstorm ways to quantify their own experiences.

### Personal Branding Exploration

#### Teaching Notes
Introduce personal branding as the process of intentionally managing how others perceive your professional identity. Explain the key elements of personal branding: value proposition, target audience, consistency, authenticity, and visibility. Use examples of effective personal brands to illustrate these concepts, including both famous professionals and relatable examples for students.

#### Facilitation Tips
- Ask students to identify brands they admire and what makes them distinctive
- Have students analyze the personal brands of professionals in their fields of interest
- Use a graphic organizer to help students visualize personal brand components
- Provide prompts for self-reflection on unique strengths and values

#### Discussion Questions
- "How does personal branding extend beyond just having a resume?"
- "What aspects of your experience, skills, or personality might make you stand out professionally?"
- "How can you ensure your personal brand remains authentic while still being professional?"
- "In what ways might your personal brand evolve throughout your career?"

#### Teaching Challenges & Solutions
- **Challenge**: Students struggle to identify their unique attributes for personal branding
  - **Solution**: Provide structured self-assessment questions and peer feedback opportunities to help students recognize their distinctive qualities
- **Challenge**: Students confuse personal branding with self-promotion or "showing off"
  - **Solution**: Emphasize that effective personal branding is about clear communication of authentic strengths, not exaggeration or pretense

#### Subsection: Brand Statement Development
Guide students through the process of creating a concise statement that captures their professional identity. Provide a template structure:
"I'm a [role/professional identity] who [unique approach or methodology] to [benefit provided]. I combine [key skill] with [complementary skill] to help [target audience] achieve [desired outcome]."

Share examples and have students draft preliminary brand statements for discussion.

### Skill Builder Activity

#### Activity Overview
The Resume Development skill builder is the cornerstone of Day 1 content and connects directly to Day 2 learning activities. This hands-on application helps students translate knowledge into practical skills by creating their own resumes using a guided tool.

**Key Connection**: This Skill Builder specifically connects to the Day 2 Learning Lab by providing the resume draft that students will improve through peer review and revision activities. The resume created today will be directly enhanced during the Digital Presence and Portfolio Workshop.

#### Activity Objectives
- Create a structured resume with all essential components
- Apply best practices for formatting and content presentation
- Implement action verbs and quantified achievements
- Develop a resume that reflects personal brand elements
- Prepare for peer review and revision in Day 2

#### Step-by-Step Facilitation
1. **Introduction (2 min)**: Explain that students will now apply what they've learned by creating their own resumes using the Resume Builder tool. Emphasize that this is a starting point that will be refined in Day 2.
2. **Tool Overview (3 min)**: Demonstrate the key features of the Resume Builder tool, including template selection, section editing, and formatting options.
3. **Template Selection (2 min)**: Guide students in selecting an appropriate template based on their target industry or personal style. Discuss considerations for different career fields.
4. **Content Development (7 min)**: Have students work independently on creating content for each resume section, using the action verb lists and examples as references. Circulate to provide assistance.
5. **Format and Review (3 min)**: Instruct students to review their formatting for consistency and professional appearance. Remind them of best practices for spacing, font usage, and visual hierarchy.
6. **Save and Prepare (1 min)**: Ensure all students have saved their work and know how to access it for Day 2 activities. Explain that they'll receive peer feedback and make revisions tomorrow.

#### Common Challenges & Solutions
- **Challenge**: Students struggle to start with a blank template
  - **Solution**: Provide prompts for each section and encourage students to focus on content first, then refine formatting
- **Challenge**: Students have difficulty describing their experiences effectively
  - **Solution**: Offer sentence starters and examples for different types of experiences; remind them to focus on achievements, not just responsibilities

  - Offer sentence starters and fill-in-the-blank options for bullet points
  - Allow collaboration with peers for brainstorming
  - Focus on completing one strong section rather than a full resume
  - Provide more frequent check-ins and guidance

- **For Advanced Students**:
  - Encourage exploration of industry-specific resume formats
  - Challenge them to create alternate versions tailored to different positions
  - Suggest incorporation of design elements that reflect personal brand
  - Ask them to develop a complementary cover letter
  - Invite them to assist peers after completing their own work

#### Examples & Models

#### Connection to Day 2
The Skill Builder activity is directly connected to the Day 2 Learning Lab and serves as essential preparation. Make these connections explicit to students:
- Day 2 will begin with peer review of the resumes created today
- The feedback received will guide targeted improvements
- The personal brand elements identified today will be expanded into a digital presence strategy
- The resume will be incorporated into a broader professional portfolio 
- Day 2 activities will help refine and strengthen the foundation built today

**Important**: Ensure students save their resume drafts and can access them for Day 2 activities. Either have them submit digitally or keep digital/physical copies in a secure location.

#### Assessment Guidance
When reviewing student work on the Resume Builder activity, look for:
- Inclusion of all essential resume components
- Use of action verbs to begin bullet points
- Attempts to quantify achievements where appropriate
- Consistent formatting and professional appearance
- Evidence of personal strengths and unique qualities

**Assessment Note**: This Skill Builder is a formative assessment opportunity. Provide feedback that will help students improve for Day 2 rather than focusing on grading.
