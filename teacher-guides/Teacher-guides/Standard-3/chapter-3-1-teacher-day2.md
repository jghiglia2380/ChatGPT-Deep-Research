## Differentiation Strategies

### For Advanced Students
- Challenge them to research and include emerging financial service providers like neobanks or fintech companies
- Ask them to analyze how consolidating services with a single provider compares to using specialized providers for different needs

- Have them analyze how changes in financial regulations might impact provider offerings and consumer choices

### For Struggling Students
- Provide a simplified research template focusing on fewer criteria
- Offer a list of specific providers to research rather than having them select their own
- Allow them to work with a partner for all activities
- Provide additional structure for the personal plan with more specific prompts
- Reduce the number of scenarios in the matchmaker challenge
- Offer a sentence stem template for presentations and peer feedback
- Focus their research on the most common provider types (banks and credit unions)

### For ELL Students
- Pair visual representations with financial terms
- Provide a glossary of key terms used in provider descriptions and fee schedules
- Create visual organizers for the research activity
- Allow use of native language resources for research
- Offer presentation script templates with fill-in-the-blank sections
- Partner ELL students with supportive peers for research and feedback
