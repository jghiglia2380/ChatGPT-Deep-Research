## Detailed Facilitation Notes

### Podcast Review & Warm-up (10 minutes)

- Begin by welcoming students to the Learning Lab and setting expectations
- Play the podcast reviewing key concepts from Day 1:
  - Types of financial service providers (traditional banks, credit unions, online banks, brokerage firms)
  - Key factors to consider (fees, rates, accessibility, services, security)
  - How needs vary based on financial goals and life stage
- After listening, quickly check for understanding with a few targeted questions:
  - "What are the main types of financial service providers we discussed yesterday?"
  - "What key factors should you consider when choosing a provider?"
  - "How might different life stages affect your choice of financial service provider?"
- Have students briefly share one insight from their comparison research
- Address any recurring questions or misconceptions from the Day 1 activity

**Facilitation Tip**: While the podcast plays, observe students' level of engagement and note any concepts that might need reinforcement during today's activities. Use this time to identify students who may not have completed their homework and prepare to pair them with others.

- Explain how these activities connect to the overall learning objectives
- Answer any questions about the Learning Lab structure or logistics

**Facilitation Tip**: Demonstrate navigation of the digital platform with a quick walk-through. Remind students that there are no "wrong answers" in many of these activities - the goal is to apply reasoning and make informed choices based on their research.

### Financial Profile Builder (15 minutes)

#### Setup & Introduction
- Explain that students will create financial profiles for three different life stages
- Show how to access and use the Financial Profile Builder tool
- Demonstrate the first profile as an example if needed
- Clarify that for each profile, students need to:
  1. Identify key financial needs and goals for that life stage
  2. Select appropriate features and services needed
  3. Match with the most suitable type of financial service provider
  4. Explain their reasoning for the match
- Emphasize that they should reference their Day 1 research when making these matches

#### During the Activity
- Monitor students as they work on their profiles
- Remind them to consider how needs change across different life stages
- Encourage students to be specific about why certain features matter for each profile
- Prompt students to think beyond just the present to anticipate future needs
- Address individual questions as they arise
- Provide guidance for students who seem stuck or uncertain

#### Group Sharing
- With 3-4 minutes remaining, have students briefly discuss their provider choices
- Ask for a few volunteers to share which providers they matched with specific profiles
- Highlight particularly thoughtful matches and reasoning
- Discuss any patterns that emerge in the matches (e.g., credit unions being popular for certain stages)

#### Key Questions to Pose:
- "How do financial needs change from young adult to mid-career to pre-retirement?"
- "Why might someone need different providers at different life stages?"
- "What features become more important as someone's financial situation becomes more complex?"
- "Are there provider types that seem to work well across multiple life stages? Why?"

### Decision-Making Simulation (10 minutes)

#### Setup & Introduction
- Explain that students will now analyze specific financial scenarios
- Show how to access and use the Decision-Making Simulation tool
- Explain that for each scenario, students will:
  1. Read about a person's financial situation and goals
  2. Consider which provider type would best meet their needs
  3. Make a recommendation with justification
  4. Compare their answer with suggested optimal choices
- Emphasize that they should apply the evaluation criteria from Day 1

#### During the Activity
- Monitor student progress through the scenarios
- Encourage students to consider all aspects of each person's situation
- Remind them to reference their provider comparison research
- Provide support for students having difficulty with certain scenarios
- Note common patterns in recommendations for group discussion

#### Support Strategies
- For students who struggle, suggest they focus on 1-2 key factors in each scenario
- Provide guiding questions to help analyze more complex scenarios
- Allow collaborative problem-solving for particularly challenging cases
- Offer hints that direct attention to critical aspects of each scenario

#### Monitoring Points:
- Observe whether students are making thoughtful, reasoned recommendations
- Check that students are considering multiple factors, not just one (like fees)
- Listen for discussions that demonstrate understanding of how financial services align with different needs
- Note whether students can articulate why certain providers are better matches than others

### Cost Calculator (10 minutes)

#### Setup & Introduction
- Explain that students will now explore the long-term impacts of fees and rates
- Demonstrate how to use the Cost Calculator tool

- Explain the three calculator components:
  1. Savings account comparison with different APYs
  2. Fee impact calculator showing erosion of savings
  3. Loan comparison tool for different interest rates
- Emphasize how small percentage differences can have significant long-term effects

#### During the Activity
- Guide students to first calculate the impact of different savings rates over 5-10 years
- Have them compare fee structures from their Day 1 research
- Suggest they test extreme scenarios to see dramatic differences
- Encourage them to calculate the cost difference of Ethan's car loan scenario from Day 1
- Assist with any calculation questions or tool usage issues

#### Discussion Prompts:
- "What surprised you most about the long-term impact of fees or rates?"
- "How much difference does 1% make over 5 years? 10 years? 30 years?"
- "Based on these calculations, which factors seem most important when choosing a provider?"
- "How might these calculations influence your own choice of financial service providers?"

**Guidance Note**: Help students connect the abstract numbers to real-life implications. For example, point out that money lost to fees over decades could represent months of retirement income or the down payment on a home.

### Reflection & Integration (5 minutes)

#### Portfolio Completion
- Guide students to the reflection and planning tool
- Explain that they will create a personal financial service provider plan based on:
  1. Their current financial needs and goals
  2. Their anticipated needs in the next 3-5 years
  3. The provider features most important to them
- Have them use the template to document their plan
- Instruct them on how to save or submit their plan
- Show how their work connects to their overall financial literacy portfolio

#### Sharing Insights
- If time allows, invite 2-3 students to briefly share one aspect of their plan
- Ask for a few volunteers to share their biggest takeaway from the Learning Lab
- Acknowledge thoughtful responses and practical applications
- Connect today's learning to future financial decisions students will make

#### Closing Message:
"Today you've applied your knowledge of financial service providers to realistic scenarios and your own financial plans. The ability to evaluate and select appropriate providers is a skill you'll use throughout your life as your financial needs evolve. Remember that there's rarely a one-size-fits-all provider, and it's worth regularly reviewing whether your financial service providers still align with your goals. The tools and evaluation methods you've practiced today will help you make informed decisions that can save you money and provide better support for your financial journey."
