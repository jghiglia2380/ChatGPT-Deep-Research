## Detailed Facilitation Notes

### Warm-up & Review (5 minutes)

- Begin by asking students to take out their Personal Charitable Giving Plans from Day 1
- Have students turn to a partner and share:
  - What cause or organization they selected and why it matters to them
  - What type of contribution they planned to make (monetary, volunteering, in-kind)
  - One thing they're curious to learn more about during today's Learning Lab
- After 3 minutes of partner discussion, ask 2-3 volunteers to share highlights with the whole class
- Connect these reflections to the Learning Lab activities they'll be completing today

**Facilitation Tip**: Use this warm-up to reactivate prior knowledge and create a bridge between Day 1 concepts and Day 2 application. Listen carefully to student responses to identify any misconceptions that should be addressed before moving into the activities.

### Activity 1: Charitable Organization Research Project (10 minutes)

#### Setup & Introduction
- Explain that making informed giving decisions requires researching organizations to ensure they're effective and aligned with personal values
- Introduce the key charity evaluation resources:
  - Charity Navigator (financial health, accountability, transparency)
  - GuideStar (comprehensive nonprofit information)
  - CharityWatch (watchdog organization focusing on efficiency)
  - BBB Wise Giving Alliance (accountability standards)
- Demonstrate how to access and interpret key information on these sites using a sample organization

#### During the Activity
- Direct students to research 2-3 organizations related to the cause they identified in their Day 1 giving plan
- Have them gather information on:
  - Mission and programs
  - Financial health (program vs. administrative expenses)
  - Contribution options
  - Evidence of impact
  - Transparency and accountability
- Circulate to assist students with navigating the research sites
- Encourage students to look beyond the numbers to understand how the organization creates impact

#### Group Sharing
- Ask students to select the organization they would most likely support based on their research
- Have 2-3 volunteers briefly share what they learned about their selected organization
- Highlight different approaches to evaluating organizations

#### Key Questions to Pose:
- "Beyond financial efficiency, what other factors should you consider when evaluating charitable organizations?"
- "How might you determine if an organization is effectively addressing the cause you care about?"
- "Why is transparency important when evaluating charitable organizations?"
- "How might your research influence your giving decisions?"

### Activity 2: Charitable Giving Budget Exercise (10 minutes)

#### Setup & Introduction
- Review the sample monthly budget provided in the student content
- Discuss different approaches to incorporating charitable giving into a budget:
  - Creating a separate category
  - Using a percentage of income approach
  - Reducing discretionary spending
  - Setting up automatic donations
- Explain that there's no single "right" percentage for givingâ€”it depends on individual circumstances and values

#### During the Activity
- Guide students through analyzing the sample budget to identify opportunities for charitable giving
- Have them create a revised budget that includes charitable giving while maintaining financial stability
- Ask them to calculate the annual impact of their proposed giving amount
- Direct them to consider how the budget might adapt to changing circumstances (income increase, emergency expenses, special appeals)
- Share Sarah's case study from the student content as an example of thoughtful budget integration

#### Support Strategies
- Provide calculators for students who need assistance with percentages
- Offer a partially completed budget worksheet for students who need more support
- Challenge advanced students to create multiple budget scenarios with different giving percentages
- Suggest that students consider how they might gradually increase giving as their income grows

#### Monitoring Points:
- Check that students are creating realistic budgets that don't compromise essential expenses
- Ensure students understand that charitable giving should be intentional, not impulsive
- Watch for students who might be setting unrealistic giving goals
- Look for creative approaches to making room for giving in tight budgets

### Activity 3: Non-Monetary Contributions Workshop (10 minutes)

#### Setup & Introduction
- Organize students into small groups of 3-4
- Provide each group with chart paper divided into four quadrants:
  - Low Time/Low Skill
  - Low Time/High Skill
  - High Time/Low Skill
  - High Time/High Skill
- Explain that non-monetary contributions can be categorized based on the time commitment and skill level required

#### During the Activity
- Ask groups to brainstorm non-monetary contribution ideas for each quadrant
- Encourage creativity and specificity in their ideas
- Suggest they consider various skills and talents (graphic design, writing, teaching, physical labor, technology, etc.)
- Have them discuss the potential value of each contribution type for:
  - Local organizations
  - Community members
  - Broader social issues
  - The volunteers themselves

#### Discussion Prompts:
- "How might contributions in different quadrants create different types of value?"
- "Which quadrant contains contributions most accessible to high school students?"
- "How might contributions shift between quadrants as you develop new skills?"
- "What non-monetary contributions might have the greatest impact for the cause you care about?"

**Guidance Note**: Emphasize that all forms of contribution are valuable, but matching the right contribution to the right need maximizes impact. Help students recognize that their specific skills and interests can create unique value for organizations.

### Activity 4: Tax Benefits Simulation (10 minutes)

#### Setup & Introduction
- Acknowledge that while tax considerations shouldn't be the primary motivation for giving, understanding potential tax benefits is part of financial literacy
- Review the basic concept of how charitable tax deductions work:
  - Itemized deductions vs. standard deduction
  - How deductions reduce taxable income (not taxes directly)
  - Documentation requirements for claiming deductions
- Walk through the sample tax scenario from the student content:
  - $60,000 annual income
  - $12,950 standard deduction (single filer)
  - $11,000 in current itemized deductions
  - 22% marginal tax rate

#### During the Activity
- Guide students through calculating the first scenario (no charitable contributions) as a class:
  - Compare standard deduction ($12,950) to itemized deductions ($11,000)
  - Determine that taking the standard deduction is more advantageous
  - Calculate taxable income: $60,000 - $12,950 = $47,050
- Have students work in pairs to calculate the remaining scenarios:
  - $2,000 in charitable contributions (itemized deductions now $13,000)
  - $5,000 in charitable contributions (itemized deductions now $16,000)
- Direct them to determine for each scenario:
  - Whether to take the standard deduction or itemize
  - Total tax liability
  - Tax savings from charitable contributions
  - Effective "cost" of the donation after tax savings

#### Key Discussion Points:
- In the first scenario (no charitable contributions), the standard deduction ($12,950) exceeds itemized deductions ($11,000), so the taxpayer would take the standard deduction
- In the second scenario ($2,000 charitable contribution), itemized deductions ($13,000) now slightly exceed the standard deduction, resulting in modest tax savings
- In the third scenario ($5,000 charitable contribution), itemized deductions ($16,000) significantly exceed the standard deduction, creating more substantial tax savings
- The "effective cost" of a donation is the amount donated minus the tax savings

**Important Note**: Emphasize that this is a simplified example for educational purposes. Actual tax situations vary based on individual circumstances, additional deductions, credits, and current tax laws. The purpose is to understand the basic concept, not provide tax advice.

### Activity 5: Community Impact Project Planning (15 minutes)

#### Setup & Introduction
- Organize students into groups of 4-5
- Explain that they will be designing a service project that addresses a specific need in their school or local community
- Review the components of an effective community service project:
  - Clear identification of a specific need
  - Realistic goals and expected impact
  - Required resources (time, materials, skills, funds)
  - Actionable timeline and steps
  - Defined roles and responsibilities
  - Measurable success criteria

#### During the Activity
- Give groups 10-12 minutes to develop their project plans using the provided template
- Encourage them to think of specific, practical projects that high school students could realistically implement
- Suggest they consider projects related to the charitable causes they identified in Day 1
- Circulate among groups to provide guidance and ask probing questions
- Remind groups to include details about required resources and implementation steps

#### Group Pitches
- Have each group deliver a 1-minute pitch of their project to the class
- Ask the audience to provide one piece of constructive feedback and one strength for each pitch
- Highlight innovative approaches and practical implementation plans

#### Discussion Prompts:
- "What challenges might you face in implementing your community impact project?"
- "How could you overcome these obstacles?"
- "What resources would you need to gather before starting implementation?"
- "How would you measure the success of your project?"

**Guidance Note**: Emphasize that effective service projects are specific, measurable, and address actual community needs. Encourage students to consider how they might engage others in their projects and create sustainable impact.

### Portfolio Project & Reflection (10 minutes)

#### Portfolio Project Introduction
- Introduce the Personal Giving Strategy portfolio project as a culmination of both Day 1 and Day 2 learning
- Walk through the three required sections:
  - Values and Interests Assessment
  - Giving Plan
  - Impact Evaluation
- Explain that this comprehensive strategy should integrate concepts from all the Learning Lab activities
- Show examples of visual elements students might include (charts, timelines, infographics)
- Set clear expectations for completion and submission

#### Reflection Time
- Provide 5 minutes for students to respond to the reflection questions in writing:
  - How has your understanding of charitable giving changed as a result of this Learning Lab?
  - What form of giving do you think will be most relevant to you in the next 5 years? Why?
  - How might integrating charitable giving into your financial planning benefit you personally while also benefiting others?
  - What is one action you commit to taking in the next month to support a cause you care about?
- Ask 2-3 volunteers to share one of their reflections with the class

#### Closing Message:
Emphasize that charitable giving is both a financial decision and an expression of personal values. Remind students that everyone can contribute regardless of financial resources, and that thoughtful, strategic giving creates the greatest impact. Encourage them to see charitable giving as an integral part of financial planning that evolves throughout their lives.

## Differentiation Strategies

### For Advanced Students
- Challenge them to research and incorporate more sophisticated giving vehicles (donor-advised funds, giving circles, etc.) in their portfolio projects
- Suggest they create a 5-year giving plan that evolves with projected life changes
- Ask them to analyze the financial statements of multiple charitable organizations and create a comparative analysis
- Have them design a detailed implementation plan for their community impact project that could be presented to school administration
- Encourage them to explore the intersection of impact investing and charitable giving

### For Struggling Students
- Provide simplified worksheets with more structured prompts
- Offer a partially completed budget worksheet for the charitable giving budget exercise
- Assign specific roles in group activities that align with individual strengths
- Create step-by-step guides for navigating charity evaluation websites
- Provide additional examples and models for the portfolio project
- Allow for verbal or visual alternatives to written reflections

### For ELL Students
- Provide a glossary of charitable giving and tax terminology
- Use visual aids and diagrams to explain complex concepts like tax deductions
- Allow for drawing or diagramming as alternatives to written responses
- Provide sentence starters for reflection questions
- Pair with supportive peers during group activities
- Connect charitable giving concepts to cultural traditions of giving that may be familiar
