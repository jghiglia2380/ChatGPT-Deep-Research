## Section-by-Section Teaching Notes

### Learning Objectives

#### Teaching Notes
This section establishes the importance of research before charitable giving. Emphasize that charitable giving is positive, but informed giving is more effective and impactful. Make connections to financial literacy as a whole—just as we research before making investments or large purchases, we should research charitable organizations.

#### Facilitation Tips
- Begin by asking students if they or their families have ever donated to a charity or volunteered
- Introduce the concept of "effective giving" versus just "giving"
- Establish the link between personal values and charitable choices

#### Objective Unpacking
- **Understand the importance of researching charitable organizations before donating**: Key points: Not all charities are equally effective; some are fraudulent; research maximizes impact
- **Evaluate the transparency and financial health of nonprofit organizations**: Key points: Understanding financial metrics; recognizing honest communication; assessing sustainability
- **Apply the PACED decision-making model to compare charitable organizations**: Key points: Systematic evaluation; comparing alternatives; prioritizing criteria
- **Use charity evaluation tools to assess organization effectiveness**: Key points: Leveraging existing research; understanding ratings; accessing public information
- **Align charitable giving decisions with personal values and goals**: Key points: Values-based giving; finding mission alignment; personal connection to causes

### Introduction

#### Teaching Notes
The introduction frames charity evaluation as an essential financial literacy skill. Highlight that charitable giving is a significant part of many people's financial lives, and applying critical thinking to these decisions increases both personal satisfaction and societal benefit.

#### Facilitation Tips
- Share a personal example of a time you researched before giving (or a hypothetical example)
- Display statistics about charitable giving in the US to show its significance
- Clarify that scrutinizing charities isn't about distrust, but about maximizing positive impact

#### Potential Misconceptions
- "All charities are equally good if they have good intentions"
- "High administrative costs always indicate a bad charity"
- "Small charities are less effective than large ones"
- "Once I've vetted a charity, I never need to check it again"

#### Discussion Starters
- "Have you ever wondered how to tell if a charity is using donations effectively?"
- "What information would you want to know before donating to an organization?"
- "How might charitable giving connect to your personal values and financial goals?"

### Key Concepts

#### Teaching Notes
The key terms section introduces essential vocabulary students need for this topic. Take time to explain each concept clearly, as these form the foundation for understanding charity evaluation.

#### Facilitation Tips
- Provide real-world examples for each term
- Create visual representations of concepts where possible
- Check for understanding before moving on

#### Concept Deep Dives
- **Charitable Organization**
  - Elaboration: Explain the distinction between nonprofits, 501(c)(3)s, and other tax-exempt organizations
  - Common confusion: Students may not understand the legal structure of nonprofits versus for-profit companies

- **Transparency**
  - Elaboration: Discuss specific ways organizations demonstrate transparency (publishing financials, impact reports, etc.)
  - Common confusion: Students may think transparency only relates to financial information

- **Administrative Costs**
  - Elaboration: Explain that some administrative costs are necessary and legitimate for effective operations
  - Common confusion: Students often believe lower administrative costs always indicate a better charity

- **Program Effectiveness**
  - Elaboration: Discuss how organizations measure and report their impact
  - Common confusion: Students may focus only on numerical outputs rather than meaningful outcomes

- **Form 990**
  - Elaboration: Show a sample Form 990 and highlight key sections
  - Common confusion: Students may be intimidated by the technical nature of tax forms

#### Comprehension Check Questions
- "What's the difference between a 'good cause' and an 'effective charity'?"
- "Why might some administrative costs be necessary for a charity to function well?"
- "How might a charity demonstrate transparency beyond just sharing financial information?"

### Deeper Exploration

#### Teaching Notes
This section provides students with detailed information about charity evaluation methods. Focus on making these technical concepts accessible and practical. The section covering the PACED decision-making model is particularly important as it provides a structured framework students can apply immediately.

#### Facilitation Tips
- Demonstrate how to use at least one charity evaluation tool live
- Provide guided practice with interpreting financial health indicators
- Walk through a simple PACED example as a class

#### Discussion Questions
- "Why might organizations with similar missions have different approaches to spending?"
- "How would you balance administrative costs against program effectiveness when evaluating a charity?"
- "Which charity evaluation tool seems most useful to you and why?"

#### Teaching Challenges & Solutions
- **Challenge**: Students may be overwhelmed by technical financial metrics
  - **Solution**: Simplify metrics to "money in, money out, and impact created" before introducing more complex ratios
- **Challenge**: Students may lack context for what constitutes "reasonable" financial metrics
  - **Solution**: Provide benchmark data showing typical ranges for different types of charities

#### Subsection: Charity Evaluation Tools
- Demonstrate how to navigate these websites, focusing on the most essential information
- Show specifically where to find star ratings, financial efficiency metrics, and transparency scores
- Discuss the limitations of these tools and why using multiple sources is beneficial

#### Subsection: The PACED Decision-Making Model
- Connect this model to other financial decisions students might make
- Emphasize that criteria should reflect personal values—there's no universal "best charity"
- Provide a simple worksheet to guide students through applying PACED to charity evaluation

### Real-World Examples

#### Teaching Notes
The case studies in this section bring abstract concepts into concrete reality. Use these examples to demonstrate how charity evaluation works in practice. Emphasize that the goal isn't to judge which charity is "better" in absolute terms, but which better aligns with the donor's specific priorities and values.

#### Facilitation Tips
- Ask students to identify specific evidence in each case study that supports or raises concerns
- Highlight how the PACED model applies to Maria's decision-making process
- Use the fraudulent charity example to emphasize the importance of verification

#### Example Analysis
- **Environmental Charities Comparison**
  - Key points to emphasize: Different organizational models can be legitimate; local vs. global impact; trade-offs between administrative costs and research capability
  - Discussion questions: "How did Maria's values influence her decision? Would you have made the same choice?"

- **Fraudulent Charity Identification**
  - Key points to emphasize: Red flags; importance of verification; how to research effectively; reporting mechanisms
  - Discussion questions: "What specific steps did John take that protected him from the scam? What additional verification steps might he have taken?"

#### Extension Activity
Have students identify a charity they're familiar with (perhaps one that fundraises at school) and apply the evaluation criteria from the lesson to assess its effectiveness. This creates immediate relevance and application.

### Summary

#### Teaching Notes
The summary reinforces key concepts and prepares students for the Skill Builder activity. Use this section to consolidate learning and address any lingering questions before moving to application.

#### Facilitation Tips
- Ask students to restate key points in their own words
- Correct any misconceptions that have persisted

#### Key Takeaways to Emphasize
- Research before giving maximizes the impact of contributions
- Multiple tools exist to help evaluate charitable organizations
- The PACED decision-making model provides a structured approach to comparing options
- Personal values should guide charitable giving decisions
- Red flags can help identify potentially problematic organizations

### Reflection Prompt

#### Teaching Notes
The reflection prompt helps students personalize the concepts from the lesson. It asks them to consider their own giving criteria and values, creating a bridge to the Skill Builder activity.

#### Facilitation Tips
- Allow sufficient quiet think time for students to formulate thoughtful responses
- Consider having students share responses in pairs before group discussion
- Validate diverse approaches to criteria selection

#### Additional Reflection Prompts
- "How might your criteria for evaluating charities change depending on the cause area?"
- "What balance would you strike between emotional connection and objective evaluation?"
- "How might your approach to charitable giving evolve as your financial situation changes over time?"

#### Reflection-to-Skill Builder Connection
Make sure students understand how their reflections should inform their approach to the upcoming Skill Builder activity. This transition is crucial for helping students connect personal reflection to practical application. Emphasize that the criteria they identified in their reflection can guide their charity research.

### Skill Builder Activity

#### Activity Overview
The Charity Evaluation Skill Builder is the cornerstone of Day 1 content and connects directly to Day 2 learning activities. This hands-on application helps students translate knowledge into practical skills.

**Key Connection**: This Skill Builder specifically connects to the Day 2 Learning Lab by having students practice researching a single organization, which prepares them for the more complex evaluations they'll conduct in Day 2 activities. The work students complete here will be directly built upon during the Learning Lab.

#### Activity Objectives
- Apply charity evaluation tools to research a real organization
- Analyze financial health and transparency indicators
- Make evidence-based assessments about organizational effectiveness
- Practice critical thinking about charitable giving

#### Step-by-Step Facilitation
1. **Introduction (2-3 min)**: Explain that students will research a real charitable organization using the tools discussed in class. They may choose an organization they're familiar with or interested in.
2. **Instructions & Examples (3-5 min)**: Demonstrate how to use Charity Navigator or GuideStar to find key information. Show a completed example of the research questions to model expectations.
3. **Individual/Group Work (5-8 min)**: Allow students to begin their research, circulating to assist with navigation of the websites and interpretation of information.
4. **Progress Check (1-2 min)**: After several minutes, check in with the class to address common challenges and share helpful strategies discovered.
5. **Continued Work (5-8 min)**: Allow students to complete their research and answer the reflection questions.
6. **Sharing & Discussion (3-5 min)**: Invite volunteers to share interesting findings about their chosen organizations. Discuss patterns observed across different types of charities.
7. **Connection to Day 2 (1-2 min)**: Preview how tomorrow's Learning Lab will expand on this research to develop personal evaluation frameworks and giving plans.

#### Common Challenges & Solutions
- **Challenge**: Students struggle to find specific organizations in the databases
  - **Solution**: Suggest searching by EIN (tax ID) if available, or trying variations of the organization name
- **Challenge**: Wide variation in completion time
  - **Solution**: Have extension questions ready for early finishers, such as comparing their organization to another in the same cause area
- **Challenge**: Superficial responses
  - **Solution**: Ask probing questions that encourage deeper analysis, such as "What does this program ratio tell you about their priorities?"
- **Challenge**: Technical issues with digital tools
  - **Solution**: Have printouts of sample charity reports as backup, or arrange peer assistance

#### Differentiation Strategies
- **For Students Who Need Support**:
  - Provide a list of pre-selected organizations that are easy to research
  - Offer a simplified worksheet with fewer, more direct questions
  - Provide a glossary of technical terms they might encounter
  - Partner struggling students with peers who can assist with navigation

- **For Advanced Students**:
  - Challenge them to research an international organization with more complex reporting
  - Ask them to evaluate an organization in a controversial cause area
  - Have them compare multiple organizations in the same field
  - Encourage deeper analysis of Form 990 details beyond basic metrics

#### Examples & Models
- **Basic Example**: A student researches the American Red Cross, identifies its mission, notes that 90% of funds go to programs, and observes that it measures success through people served. They decide they would support it because of its high program ratio and clear impact measurements.
- **Exemplary Example**: A student researches a local homeless services organization, analyzes its financial trends over three years, examines its program effectiveness metrics beyond just money spent, investigates its leadership structure and compensation, and makes a nuanced recommendation that acknowledges both strengths and areas for improvement.

#### Connection to Day 2
The Skill Builder activity is directly connected to the Day 2 Learning Lab and serves as essential preparation. Make these connections explicit to students:
- Day 2, Station 1 builds on the research skills practiced in the Skill Builder but applies them to assigned organizations
- Day 2, Station 2 expands the evaluation concept by having students create their own assessment frameworks
- The Skill Builder will be referenced during the Day 2 portfolio development as students create comprehensive giving strategies

**Important**: Ensure students save their Skill Builder work, as they will need it for Day 2 activities. Either have them submit digitally or keep physical copies in a secure location.

#### Assessment Guidance
When reviewing student work on the Skill Builder activity, look for:
- Demonstration of key concepts from the lesson
- Personal application and relevance
- Thoroughness and completion of all components
- Creative problem-solving and critical thinking
- Preparation for Day 2 learning extensions

**Assessment Note**: This Skill Builder is a formative assessment opportunity. Provide feedback that will help students improve for Day 2 rather than focusing on grading.

**Feedback Approach**: When providing feedback, focus on one strength ("I notice you did X well") and one area for growth ("For Day 2, consider expanding on Y").

## Conclusion and Next Steps

As you conclude the lesson, emphasize to students the importance of saving their work. This is critical as their work will serve as the foundation for Day 2 Learning Lab activities.

### Ensuring Work is Saved
- Remind students that their work is automatically saved in the system
- For additional security, have students take screenshots of their completed work
- Suggest students make notes of key decisions for quick reference in Day 2
- Preview how they'll expand on this foundation during the Learning Lab

### Preview for Day 2
Let students know that in the Day 2 Learning Lab, they will:
- Conduct a more detailed charity evaluation on assigned organizations
- Develop personalized charity evaluation criteria based on their values
- Create a strategic charitable giving plan with a mock budget
- Participate in a mock grant committee to experience philanthropic decision-making
- Learn to identify potential charity scams and protect themselves

## Discussion Prompts

### For Introduction:
"What factors would you consider important when deciding whether to donate to a charity?"
**Expected responses**: Mission alignment with personal values, reputation, how much money goes to programs vs. administration, proof of impact, transparency, leadership quality

### For Charity Evaluation Tools:
"How might different evaluation tools provide complementary information about an organization?"
**Expected responses**: One might focus on financials while another highlights governance; cross-referencing increases confidence; some tools might have more data on certain types of organizations

### For Red Flags Section:
"Why might pressure for immediate donations be a warning sign, even for legitimate causes?"
