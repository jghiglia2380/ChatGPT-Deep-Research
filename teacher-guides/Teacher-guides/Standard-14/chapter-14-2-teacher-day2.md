## Detailed Facilitation Notes

### Warm-up & Review (5 minutes)

- Begin by asking students to share one key takeaway from the previous lesson about charity evaluation
- Have students briefly discuss in pairs: "What surprised you most about evaluating charitable organizations?"
- Review the main tools discussed yesterday (Charity Navigator, GuideStar, BBB Wise Giving Alliance)
- Clarify any misconceptions from Day 1 content
- Provide an overview of today's Learning Lab activities and objectives

**Facilitation Tip**: Use this warm-up time to gauge what concepts from Day 1 might need reinforcement throughout today's activities.

### Activity 1: Charity Evaluation Workshop (15 minutes)

#### Setup & Introduction
- Divide students into pre-assigned groups of 2-3
- Assign each group one of the well-known charitable organizations (American Red Cross, Habitat for Humanity, World Wildlife Fund, Feeding America, UNICEF)
- Distribute the Charity Evaluation Worksheet to each group
- Demonstrate briefly how to efficiently find key information on evaluation websites

#### During the Activity
- Circulate among groups to ensure they're finding relevant information
- Provide guidance on interpreting financial metrics and effectiveness indicators
- Point out particularly useful sections of the evaluation websites
- Encourage groups to look beyond basic financial ratios to assess impact
- Remind groups to prepare a brief presentation of their findings

#### Group Sharing
- Keep presentations to 2-3 minutes per group
- Ask each group to highlight their key findings and recommendation
- Encourage groups to explain their reasoning, not just their conclusion
- After all presentations, facilitate a brief discussion about similarities and differences across organizations

#### Key Questions to Pose:
- "What was the most important factor in your evaluation and why?"
- "Were there any metrics that surprised you about your organization?"
- "Based on your research, would you personally support this organization? Why or why not?"
- "How might someone with different values evaluate this same organization differently?"

### Activity 2: Developing Evaluation Criteria (15 minutes)

#### Setup & Introduction
- Transition students to individual work
- Review the different aspects of charitable organizations that can be evaluated:
  - Financial efficiency and transparency
  - Program effectiveness and impact measurement
  - Leadership and governance
  - Accountability and communication
  - Alignment with personal values
- Distribute the Charity Evaluation Scorecard Template

#### During the Activity
- Walk around and check in with students as they create their personalized evaluation criteria
- Provide examples of different weighting systems (e.g., a 1-5 scale or percentage allocation)
- Encourage students to think about why certain criteria matter more to them than others
- Suggest testing their framework by applying it to a charity they're familiar with

#### Support Strategies
- For students struggling with criteria development, suggest starting with the basic categories and then getting more specific
- Provide examples of specific questions that could be used to assess each criterion
- Encourage students to consider their personal values and experiences when prioritizing criteria

#### Monitoring Points:
- Ensure students are creating practical, usable evaluation frameworks
- Check that criteria are specific enough to be measurable
- Make sure weighting systems make mathematical sense
- Verify that students are testing their criteria with at least one organization

### Activity 3: Charitable Giving Plan Simulation (20 minutes)

#### Setup & Introduction
- Introduce the scenario: Students have $1,000 to donate this year and need to create a strategic plan
- Distribute the Charitable Giving Plan Template
- Walk through an example of a philanthropic mission statement to model expectations
- Explain that students should select 2-4 organizations across 2-3 cause areas

#### During the Activity
- Encourage students to begin by identifying causes they care about before researching specific organizations
- Remind students that they can use charity evaluation tools to research potential recipients
- Suggest students consider diverse approaches (e.g., giving to one organization vs. spreading across several)
- Help students think through how they'll track the impact of their donations

#### Discussion Prompts:
- "How did you decide how much to allocate to each organization?"
- "Beyond financial donations, what other ways did you identify to support your chosen causes?"
- "How does your giving plan reflect your personal values?"
- "How might your plan change as your financial situation evolves over time?"

**Guidance Note**: Emphasize that there's no single "right" approach to charitable giving. The key is alignment between personal values, thoughtful research, and strategic allocation of resources.

### Activity 4: Mock Grant Committee (25 minutes)

#### Setup & Introduction
- Divide students into groups of 4-5 to serve as grant committees
- Distribute the four grant proposal summaries to each committee
- Explain the parameters: $10,000 to award, minimum grant $2,000, maximum $5,000 per organization
- Suggest committee roles (chair, secretary, etc.) but allow groups to self-organize
- Set clear time expectations: 10 minutes for review, 10 minutes for discussion, 5 minutes for decisions

#### During the Activity
- Circulate among committees to observe decision-making processes
- Remind committees to develop clear evaluation criteria before making decisions
- Encourage thoughtful discussion and respectful deliberation
- Ensure all committee members have a voice in the process
- Provide 5-minute and 2-minute warnings before decision time

#### Group Sharing
- Have each committee briefly share their funding decisions and rationale
- Highlight differences in approach across committees
- Discuss how different values led to different funding priorities
- Connect this experience to real-world philanthropic decision-making

#### Key Questions to Pose:
- "What evaluation criteria did your committee prioritize and why?"
- "How did you handle disagreements within your committee?"
- "Were there any proposals that generated significant debate? Why?"
- "How might this experience inform your personal approach to charitable giving?"

### Activity 5: Charity Scam Investigation (15 minutes)

#### Setup & Introduction
- Review the list of common red flags that might indicate a charity scam:
  - Pressure for immediate donations
  - Thank you for previous donations you don't remember making
  - Similar names to well-known organizations
  - Vague mission statements or program descriptions
  - Limited or no financial information available
  - No proof of tax-exempt status
  - Excessive administrative or fundraising costs
- Distribute the charity profiles (both legitimate and problematic)

#### During the Activity
- Have students work individually or in pairs to analyze each profile
- Encourage students to be specific in identifying red flags
- Ask students to note questions they would want answered before donating
- Prompt students to consider verification steps they would take

#### Discussion Prompts:
- "Which red flags were the most obvious and which were more subtle?"
- "What verification steps would you take for organizations that raised concerns?"
- "How can consumers protect themselves from charity scams while still supporting worthy causes?"
- "What legitimate reasons might a charity have for something that initially appears to be a red flag?"

**Guidance Note**: Emphasize that the goal is not to become cynical about charitable giving, but to develop healthy skepticism and verification habits that protect both donors and legitimate causes.

### Portfolio Building: Charitable Giving Strategy (10 minutes)

#### Setup & Introduction
- Transition students to creating their personal charitable giving strategy document
- Explain that this document synthesizes all the learning from the activities
- Provide the portfolio template with sections for:
  - Philanthropic values statement
  - Evaluation criteria
  - Research resources
  - Giving plan
  - Red flag checklist

#### During the Activity
- Encourage students to incorporate insights from each of today's activities
- Remind students that this is a living document that can evolve over time
- Suggest that students think about both short-term and long-term giving strategies
- Emphasize the connection between charitable giving and overall financial planning

#### Monitoring Points:
- Check that portfolios include specific, actionable content, not just general statements
- Ensure the giving strategy reflects personal values and priorities
- Verify that students include concrete tools and resources for future reference
- Look for integration of concepts across all Learning Lab activities

### Reflection & Wrap-up (5 minutes)

#### Portfolio Completion
- Allow students a few minutes to finalize their charitable giving strategy
- Remind students that this strategy can be adapted as their financial situation and priorities evolve
- Suggest that students share their strategy with family members who might be involved in household financial decisions

#### Sharing Insights
- Ask for 2-3 volunteers to share one insight from today's Learning Lab
- Highlight connections between charity evaluation and other financial literacy skills
- Ask students to consider how they might apply these evaluation skills to other decisions in their lives

#### Closing Message:
"The skills you've developed over these two days extend beyond charitable giving. Critical evaluation, research-based decision-making, alignment with personal values, and strategic planning apply to many aspects of financial literacy. As you encounter opportunities to give in the future, remember that informed giving maximizes both your personal satisfaction and the positive impact you can have on causes you care about."
