## Detailed Facilitation Notes

### Warm-up & Review (5 minutes)

- Begin by reminding students of the key insurance cost components from Day 1: premiums, deductibles, co-payments, and co-insurance
- Review the calculation process for determining out-of-pocket costs in insurance scenarios
- Connect to the Day 1 Skill Builder activity and ask students to summarize what they learned
- Provide a quick practice problem similar to the Day 1 Skill Builder to refresh calculation skills
- Outline the Learning Lab structure and explain how the activities build upon each other
- Emphasize that today's focus is on applying these concepts to make real-world decisions

**Facilitation Tip**: Have a visual aid showing the relationship between insurance components to remind students of the sequential payment process.

### Activity 1: Insurance Cost Calculation Challenge (10 minutes)

#### Setup & Introduction
- Introduce the activity as an extension of the Day 1 Skill Builder with more complex scenarios
- Distribute or provide access to the Insurance Cost Calculator Spreadsheet
- Present a health insurance scenario with multiple medical events throughout the year
- Explain that students will calculate costs at each stage and analyze the impact of different components

#### During the Activity
- Circulate to help students with calculation questions
- Prompt students to notice how costs accumulate throughout the year
- Encourage students to identify which cost components have the largest impact
- Have students compare how costs would differ with minimal versus heavy healthcare utilization
- Remind students to consider all components: premiums, deductibles, co-payments, and co-insurance

#### Group Sharing
- Have volunteers share their total calculated costs
- Discuss patterns in how costs change with different usage levels
- Analyze which plan features have the most significant impact on total costs
- Connect these calculations to the next activity on plan comparison

#### Key Questions to Pose:
- "How do your total costs change if you have one major medical event versus many smaller ones?"
- "At what point does the out-of-pocket maximum become relevant in your calculations?"
- "Which cost component had the biggest impact on your total expenses?"
- "How would these calculations change if you were comparing plans for a family rather than an individual?"

### Activity 2: Comprehensive Insurance Plan Comparison (15 minutes)

#### Setup & Introduction
- Transition from single plan calculations to comparing multiple insurance options
- Provide the Insurance Plan Comparison Template 
- Present three health insurance plans with different structures:
  - Plan A: Low deductible, higher premium
  - Plan B: Medium deductible, medium premium
  - Plan C: High deductible, lower premium (HSA-eligible)
- Explain that students will compare total costs under minimal, moderate, and heavy usage scenarios
- Introduce a similar comparison for auto insurance with different coverage levels

#### During the Activity
- Guide students through the template structure
- Remind students to include both premiums and potential out-of-pocket costs
- Encourage them to create "usage scenarios" that reflect different possibilities
- For health insurance: minimal (routine care), moderate (a few appointments), heavy (major procedure)
- For auto insurance: no claims, minor claim, major accident
- Emphasize the importance of probability in decision-making

#### Support Strategies
- Provide a completed example for those struggling with the comparison structure
- Create a calculation cheat sheet for reference
- Offer guided questions to help students interpret their comparison results
- For advanced students, suggest adding additional variables like tax benefits of HSAs

#### Monitoring Points:
- Check that students are correctly calculating total annual costs (premiums + out-of-pocket)
- Ensure students understand why different plans might be optimal under different usage scenarios
- Watch for students who focus only on premiums without considering potential out-of-pocket costs
- Look for students who can articulate the trade-offs between different plan structures

### Activity 3: Cost-Saving Strategy Evaluation (10 minutes)

#### Setup & Introduction
- Introduce five major cost-saving strategies for insurance:
  1. Increasing deductibles for lower premiums
  2. Using Health Savings Accounts (HSAs) for tax benefits
  3. Bundling multiple policies with one insurer
  4. Working to raise credit score for better rates
  5. Taking full advantage of employer benefits
- Provide the Cost-Saving Strategy Guide with details on each approach
- Present three different personas with distinct financial profiles:
  - Recent graduate with limited savings but good health
  - Mid-career professional with family and established emergency fund
  - Pre-retirement parent with health concerns and stable finances

#### During the Activity
- Have students evaluate which strategies work best for each persona
- Encourage them to consider both financial and practical implications
- Remind students to think about short-term versus long-term benefits
- Ask them to rank strategies for each persona and justify their rankings
- Have students calculate potential savings for their top strategy for each persona

#### Discussion Prompts:
- "Which persona would benefit most from a high-deductible health plan with an HSA? Why?"
- "How might financial stability affect your strategy recommendations?"
- "What non-financial factors might influence which strategies are most appropriate?"
- "How might these strategy recommendations change over a person's lifetime?"

**Guidance Note**: Emphasize that there are no universally "best" strategiesâ€”recommendations should be tailored to individual circumstances. This builds critical thinking rather than memorization of rules.

### Activity 4: Insurance Decision Framework & Cost Management Plan (10 minutes)

#### Setup & Introduction
- Explain that students will now develop a systematic approach to insurance decisions
- Introduce the Insurance Decision Framework Template
- Present the five key steps in insurance decision-making:
  1. Needs assessment (what risks need coverage)
  2. Plan comparison (options analysis)
  3. Scenario analysis (best/worst cases)
  4. Non-financial considerations
  5. Decision and implementation
- Connect to the Personal Insurance Budget Planner for creating cost management plans

#### During the Activity
- Guide students in creating personalized decision frameworks
- Encourage them to develop concrete criteria for evaluating insurance options
- Help students apply the framework to a specific insurance type
- Transition to developing personalized insurance cost management plans
- Have students include current/anticipated needs, cost-saving opportunities, strategy, timeline, and evaluation metrics

#### Discussion Prompts:
- "What factors should be weighted most heavily in your decision framework?"
- "How might your framework change for different types of insurance?"
- "What timeline would you set for implementing your cost management plan?"
- "How would you evaluate whether your insurance decisions were effective?"

**Guidance Note**: Encourage students to think about real-world application to their future situations. These frameworks should be practical tools they can use when making actual insurance decisions.

### Reflection & Wrap-up (5 minutes)

#### Portfolio Completion
- Guide students in organizing their work from all stations into a cohesive portfolio
- Have them create a brief summary that connects all activities
- Encourage them to add a personal reflection on key insights gained
- Remind them to save their work as it demonstrates valuable analytical skills

#### Sharing Insights
- Have volunteers share one key insight from their work
- Ask students to explain how their understanding of insurance costs has evolved
- Discuss how these skills connect to other financial decision-making processes
- Emphasize the practical application of these concepts in their future lives

#### Closing Message:
Insurance decisions are among the most complex financial choices most adults face. The analytical frameworks and calculation skills you've developed in this Learning Lab will help you navigate these decisions with confidence. Remember that insurance is ultimately about balancing immediate costs against potential future expenses, and the "right" choice depends on your unique financial situation, risk tolerance, and priorities.

## Summative Assessment Guide

### Learning Lab Deliverable: Insurance Cost Analysis and Management Portfolio

#### Assessment Criteria
- Accuracy of calculations in all insurance scenarios
- Depth of analysis in plan comparisons
- Appropriateness of strategy recommendations for different situations
- Clarity and practicality of decision framework
- Specificity and realism of cost management plan
- Integration of concepts across all activities

#### Success Indicators
- **Excellent Work**: Calculations are precise and comprehensive across multiple scenarios. Plan comparisons include detailed analysis of trade-offs under different usage patterns. Strategy recommendations are nuanced and tailored to specific personas with clear rationales. Decision framework is systematic and includes weighted criteria. Cost management plan is detailed with specific actions, timeline, and evaluation methods.

- **Proficient Work**: Calculations are mostly accurate with minor errors. Plan comparisons address key differences with basic analysis. Strategy recommendations are reasonable for each persona. Decision framework includes major considerations in a logical sequence. Cost management plan includes general actions and timeline.

- **Needs Improvement**: Calculations contain significant errors. Plan comparisons are superficial or focus only on one factor. Strategy recommendations are generic or inappropriate for the personas. Decision framework is disorganized or missing key elements. Cost management plan lacks specificity or realism.

**Recommendation**: When assessing portfolios, focus on students' analytical approach and reasoning rather than specific conclusions. The ability to evaluate trade-offs and adapt recommendations to different circumstances demonstrates deeper learning than simply arriving at a predetermined "right answer."
