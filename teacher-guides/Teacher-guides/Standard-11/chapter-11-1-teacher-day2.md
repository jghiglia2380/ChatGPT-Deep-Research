## Detailed Facilitation Notes

### Warm-up & Review (5 minutes)

- Begin with the risk perception exercise, having students rate likelihood and severity of common risks
- Guide students in calculating risk ratings (Likelihood × Severity)
- Facilitate a brief discussion about how personal experiences and biases affect risk perception
- Review key concepts from Day 1:
  - Four types of risk (personal, property, liability, financial)
  - Four risk management strategies (avoid, reduce, accept, transfer)
  - Risk tolerance and its impact on decision-making
  - Insurance as a risk transfer mechanism

**Facilitation Tip**: Create a quick visual representation of the class's aggregate risk ratings on the board. This helps students see how risk perception varies among their peers and can spark discussion about why these differences exist.

### Activity 1: Risk Management Case Studies (12 minutes)

#### Setup & Introduction
- Divide students into small groups of 3-4
- Distribute case study materials to each group
- Explain that they'll analyze complex scenarios with multiple risk factors
- Clarify that groups should develop comprehensive risk management plans that may include multiple strategies
- Remind students to use the analytical framework from Day 1's Skill Builder

#### During the Activity
- Assign each group one case study (or allow choice if time permits)
- Instruct groups to:
  - Identify all significant risks in their case study
  - Categorize risks by type and priority
  - Consider appropriate management strategies for each risk
  - Develop a comprehensive plan addressing all major concerns
  - Justify their recommendations with specific reasoning
- Circulate among groups to provide guidance and prompt deeper analysis
- Encourage groups to consider multiple management strategies rather than relying solely on insurance

#### Group Sharing
- Have each group briefly share their case analysis (1-2 minutes per group)
- Ask other groups to offer one additional consideration for each presented case
- Highlight effective approaches and suggest additional considerations as needed
- Emphasize the importance of comprehensive analysis that addresses multiple risk types

#### Key Questions to Pose:
- "How did you prioritize the risks you identified in your case?"
- "Which risk management strategy seemed most crucial for your scenario, and why?"
- "What factors influenced your decision between transferring risk through insurance and using other strategies?"
- "How might different levels of risk tolerance affect the approach to your case?"

### Activity 2: Insurance Coverage Analyzer (12 minutes)

#### Setup & Introduction
- Transition students to the insurance evaluation activity
- Distribute Insurance Coverage Analyzer worksheets
- Review key insurance terminology (premium, deductible, liability, coverage limits)
- Explain the two scenarios (auto insurance and renter's insurance)
- Emphasize that insurance decisions involve balancing protection against cost

#### During the Activity
- Have students work individually or in pairs to analyze both scenarios
- Instruct students to:
  - Compare coverage options based on protection level and cost
  - Consider the financial impact of different choices
  - Make recommendations based on the specific circumstances in each scenario
  - Justify their selections with clear reasoning
- Circulate to answer questions and provide guidance
- Prompt students to consider how changes in financial circumstances might affect their recommendations

#### Support Strategies
- For students struggling with insurance terminology, provide a quick-reference glossary
- Offer calculation assistance for students having difficulty with the financial comparisons
- Provide guiding questions for students who need additional structure
- Have ready examples of how to balance cost vs. protection in different situations

#### Monitoring Points:
- Ensure students are considering the specific circumstances in each scenario, not just choosing the most expensive option
- Check that students understand the trade-off between premium costs and deductible amounts
- Verify that students are considering the potential financial impact of being underinsured
- Make sure recommendations include clear justifications based on scenario details

### Activity 3: Risk Tolerance Assessment (10 minutes)

#### Setup & Introduction
- Introduce the concept of risk tolerance as a personal characteristic that affects financial decisions
- Distribute Risk Tolerance Assessment worksheets
- Explain that there are no "right" or "wrong" answers—the goal is self-awareness
- Review the scoring system and how to interpret results

#### During the Activity
- Have students individually complete the assessment scenarios
- Guide students to:
  - Respond honestly to each scenario based on personal preferences
  - Calculate their risk tolerance score using the provided scale
  - Reflect on what their score reveals about their approach to risk
  - Consider how their risk tolerance might affect financial decisions
- Emphasize that risk tolerance varies among individuals and can change over time
- Encourage students to think about areas of their life where they may be more or less risk-tolerant

#### Discussion Prompts:
- "How accurate do you think this assessment is of your actual risk tolerance?"
- "In what areas of your life are you more risk-averse, and where are you more risk-tolerant?"
- "How might your risk tolerance influence major financial decisions in your future?"
- "What factors do you think have shaped your current risk tolerance level?"

**Guidance Note**: Create a "risk tolerance spectrum" on the board and have students place sticky notes showing where they fall. This visual representation helps illustrate the diversity of risk preferences and can lead to productive discussions about different approaches to financial decisions.

### Activity 4: Personal Risk Management Plan (12 minutes)

#### Setup & Introduction
- Introduce the Personal Risk Management Plan as a practical tool students can use in their own lives
- Distribute plan templates and explain each component:
  - Risk identification across categories
  - Likelihood and impact assessment
  - Risk rating calculation
  - Strategy selection
  - Action step development
  - Implementation timeline
- Demonstrate how to complete the worksheet with a sample risk

#### During the Activity
- Have students work individually to create their personal risk management plans
- Guide students to:
  - Identify at least one risk in each major category (personal, property, liability, financial)
  - Rate each risk's likelihood and potential impact
  - Calculate risk ratings to prioritize attention
  - Select appropriate management strategies for each risk
  - Develop specific, actionable steps for implementing each strategy
  - Create a realistic timeline for implementation
- Circulate to provide guidance and suggestions
- Encourage students to be specific and realistic in their action steps

#### Monitoring Points:
- Check that students are considering a diverse range of risks across categories
- Ensure risk ratings are thoughtfully assessed rather than arbitrarily assigned
- Verify that management strategies match the nature of each risk
- Confirm that action steps are specific and achievable
- Make sure implementation timelines are reasonable

**Guidance Note**: For students who may be uncomfortable sharing personal risks, provide a "persona" option—they can complete the exercise for a fictional young adult with typical risks. This allows practice with the methodology while maintaining privacy.

### Reflection & Wrap-up (5 minutes)

#### Portfolio Integration
- Explain how the learning lab activities connect to form a comprehensive understanding of risk management
- Guide students to select elements from each activity to include in their portfolio:
  - Case study analysis demonstrating management strategy application
  - Insurance recommendation showing cost-benefit analysis
  - Risk tolerance insights and implications
  - Personal risk management plan highlights
- Have students write a brief summary connecting these elements to create a cohesive risk management approach

#### Sharing Insights
- Ask 2-3 students to share one key insight they gained from the learning lab
- Prompt reflection on how today's activities build on the concepts from Day 1
- Guide students through the final reflection questions:
  - Most valuable insights gained
  - Evolution of understanding about risk management
  - Most personally useful risk management strategies
  - Specific implementation steps
- Briefly introduce the Risk Management Case Analysis portfolio project (if assigning)

#### Closing Message:
Emphasize that effective risk management isn't about eliminating all risk—it's about making conscious choices about which risks to take and how to minimize their potential negative impacts while pursuing opportunities. By understanding personal risk tolerance and applying appropriate strategies to different situations, students can protect themselves while still pursuing their goals.
