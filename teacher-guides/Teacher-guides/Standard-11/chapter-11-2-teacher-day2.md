## Detailed Facilitation Notes

### Warm-up & Review (7 minutes)

- Begin by engaging students with the insurance myths and facts activity
- Have students individually identify which statements are myths and which are facts
- After 2-3 minutes, facilitate a brief whole-class discussion about common misconceptions
- Reveal and explain the correct answers:
  - Myth: Young adults don't need life insurance (explain that needs depend on individual circumstances)
  - Myth: Red cars cost more to insure (color doesn't affect premiums)
  - Fact: Credit scores can affect insurance premiums (explain the connection between risk assessment and credit)
  - Myth: Insurance always pays off auto loans (explain gap insurance concept)
  - Myth: Landlord's policy covers renters' belongings (emphasize importance of renter's insurance)
  - Myth: Health insurance always covers 100% after deductible (explain co-insurance)
  - Myth: Insurance companies can cancel anytime (discuss regulatory protections)
  - Myth: Minimum liability is sufficient (explain inadequacy for serious accidents)

- Connect the warm-up to Day 1 learning by emphasizing how understanding insurance fundamentals helps avoid costly misconceptions
- Transition to Activity 1 by explaining that students will now analyze specific insurance policies in depth

**Facilitation Tip**: Create a visual "myth-busting" display by having students use green checkmarks and red X's on a classroom display. This interactive approach increases engagement and provides a visual reference for the discussion.

### Activity 1: Policy Comparison Analysis (12 minutes)

#### Setup & Introduction
- Distribute the policy comparison worksheets with health and auto insurance scenarios

  - Out-of-pocket maximums
- Guide students through comparing the auto insurance policies in Scenario 2:
  - Liability limits and their significance
  - Collision and comprehensive coverage differences
  - Optional coverages and their value

#### During the Activity
- Have students work in pairs to complete the comparison analyses
- Circulate to provide guidance and answer questions
- Prompt deeper thinking with questions like:
  - "How would your recommendation change if the person had a chronic condition?"
  - "What are the financial implications if you cause a serious accident with the basic coverage?"
- Listen for misconceptions and clarify as needed
- Encourage students to justify their recommendations based on specific policy features

#### Group Sharing
- Have 2-3 pairs share their recommendations for each scenario
- Highlight different perspectives and the reasoning behind them
- Emphasize that the "best" policy depends on individual circumstances, risk tolerance, and financial situation

  - Demonstrate how the calculation changes based on claim frequency
  - Explain that the lowest premium isn't always the most cost-effective
- Guide students through the approach for Scenario 2 (Term Life Insurance):
  - Explain how to calculate total premium cost over the full term
  - Discuss how to evaluate protection at different life stages
  - Introduce non-financial factors in the analysis

#### During the Activity
- Have students work individually or in pairs to complete calculations
- Circulate to assist with calculations and provide feedback
- Ask questions to deepen analysis:
  - "How does your emergency fund affect your deductible decision?"
  - "What non-financial factors might influence your life insurance choice?"
  - "How would your recommendation change if the person's financial situation were different?"
- Encourage students to explain their reasoning, not just provide calculations
- Provide time checks (5 minutes remaining, 2 minutes remaining)

#### Discussion Prompts:
- "How did your analysis of the homeowner's insurance options change based on claim frequency?"
- "What factors beyond cost did you consider in your life insurance recommendation?"
- "How might someone's risk tolerance affect their insurance decisions?"
- "What did this analysis teach you about the relationship between premiums and deductibles?"

**Guidance Note**: Some students may struggle with the calculations. Consider having a completed example to show or allowing peer assistance. Emphasize that understanding the process of cost-benefit analysis is more important than getting perfect calculations.
