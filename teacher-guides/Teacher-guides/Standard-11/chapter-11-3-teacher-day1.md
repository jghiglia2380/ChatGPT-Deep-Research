## Section-by-Section Teaching Notes

### Learning Objectives

#### Teaching Notes
Begin by connecting insurance costs to students' lives and future decisions. Emphasize that understanding these concepts now will help them make better financial decisions when they select insurance plans as adults. Frame the learning objectives as practical life skills rather than abstract concepts.

#### Facilitation Tips
- Ask students if they've heard family members discuss insurance costs or choices
- Use a brief poll to gauge initial understanding of insurance cost components
- Highlight the balance between monthly costs (premiums) and potential out-of-pocket expenses
- Connect to previous lessons on risk management and insurance types

#### Objective Unpacking
- **Understand basic components of insurance policies**: Key points: Students need to recognize the four major cost components and their definitions.
- **Recognize how different insurance terms impact out-of-pocket costs**: Key points: Higher premiums typically mean lower out-of-pocket costs and vice versa.
- **Learn strategies for selecting insurance policies**: Key points: Decision framework based on personal financial situation and risk tolerance.
- **Analyze real-world scenarios**: Key points: Applying concepts to practical scenarios builds decision-making skills.

### Introduction

#### Teaching Notes
The introduction should establish why insurance cost management matters. Use accessible examples that connect to students' potential near-future experiences, such as selecting health insurance at their first job or auto insurance when purchasing a car. Emphasize the balance between premiums and potential out-of-pocket costs.

#### Facilitation Tips
- Start with a relatable scenario: "Imagine you're starting your first job after college, and you need to select health insurance from three options..."
- Use real premium examples for auto insurance for young adults to show actual costs
- Emphasize that insurance decisions involve financial trade-offs
- Ask students what factors they think might affect insurance costs

#### Potential Misconceptions
- Insurance with the lowest premium is always the best deal
- Insurance covers all costs once you've paid the deductible
- All types of insurance work exactly the same way
- Insurance terms are standardized across all insurance types and companies

#### Discussion Starters
- "What do you think is the relationship between how much you pay for insurance each month and how much you pay when you use it?"
- "When might it make sense to pay a higher monthly premium for insurance?"
- "What factors do you think insurance companies consider when setting your costs?"

### Key Concepts

#### Teaching Notes
This section introduces the fundamental building blocks of insurance costs. Take time to clearly define each component, provide examples, and check for understanding before moving to the next. Use visuals and analogies to make abstract concepts concrete. The sequential presentation of concepts is critical for student understanding.

#### Facilitation Tips
- Create a glossary on the board that builds as you introduce each term
- Use consistent dollar amounts across examples for easier comparison
- Have students explain concepts back to you in their own words
- Use color-coding to distinguish different components in your examples

#### Concept Deep Dives
- **Premium**
  - Elaboration: The "subscription fee" for insurance; emphasize that this is paid regardless of whether you use the insurance
  - Common confusion: Students often don't realize premiums continue even when making claims

- **Deductible**
  - Elaboration: The "threshold" you must cross before insurance begins helping; use a concrete example like a $500 deductible on a $3,000 repair
  - Common confusion: Many students think the deductible is paid to the insurance company rather than as part of the service payment

- **Co-payment (Co-pay)**
  - Elaboration: The "flat fee" paid for specific services; emphasize that these are predetermined fixed amounts
  - Common confusion: Students often confuse co-pays with co-insurance since both involve sharing costs

- **Co-insurance**
  - Elaboration: The "percentage split" after meeting your deductible; walk through a calculation showing the consumer's portion
  - Common confusion: Students struggle to understand that co-insurance applies after the deductible but before reaching the out-of-pocket maximum

- **Out-of-pocket Maximum**
  - Elaboration: The "financial safety net" that caps your total spending; emphasize that this protects against catastrophic expenses
  - Common confusion: Students often don't realize premiums don't count toward the out-of-pocket maximum

#### Comprehension Check Questions
- "If your annual premium is $1,200, your deductible is $500, and you have a $2,000 claim, how much would you pay out-of-pocket?"
- "What's the difference between a co-payment and co-insurance?"
- "If you have a $2,500 out-of-pocket maximum and have already paid $2,000 in deductibles and co-insurance this year, what's the maximum you would pay for another covered service?"

### Deeper Exploration

#### Teaching Notes
This section builds on the individual components by exploring how they interact and affect total insurance costs. Use multiple scenarios to demonstrate the premium vs. out-of-pocket cost trade-off. Then introduce strategies for managing insurance costs, emphasizing that the "best" approach depends on individual circumstances.

#### Facilitation Tips
- Use a flowchart to show the sequential payment process in health insurance claims
- Compare multiple insurance plans side-by-side to illustrate trade-offs
- Encourage students to identify which strategies might work best for different life situations
- Highlight real-world applications like HSAs and FSAs that they'll encounter as adults

#### Discussion Questions
- "How might your choice of deductible change based on your financial situation and emergency fund?"
- "What factors besides cost should you consider when selecting insurance?"
- "How might your insurance needs and choices change throughout different life stages?"

#### Teaching Challenges & Solutions
- **Challenge**: Students struggle to understand the sequential payment process
  - **Solution**: Use a visual timeline showing when each component applies during a claim
- **Challenge**: Students focus solely on premiums when comparing plans
  - **Solution**: Create scenarios with different usage levels to show how total costs vary

#### Subsection: The Relationship Between Components
- Demonstrate how components work together in a claim scenario
- Illustrate the premium vs. out-of-pocket cost trade-off with concrete examples
- Show a "typical" claim processing sequence: premium → deductible → co-insurance → out-of-pocket maximum
- Emphasize that higher deductible plans have lower premiums but higher potential out-of-pocket costs

#### Subsection: Cost Management Strategies
- Review each strategy in detail with concrete examples
- Discuss how to choose appropriate deductibles based on financial situation
- Explain tax-advantaged accounts like HSAs and FSAs
- Emphasize the importance of staying in-network and utilizing preventive benefits
- Discuss shopping around, bundling policies, and taking advantage of discounts

### Real-World Examples

#### Teaching Notes
This section grounds abstract concepts in concrete scenarios. Present detailed case studies with insurance plan comparisons and walk students through the analysis. These examples bridge theoretical understanding with practical application and prepare students for the skill builder activity.

#### Facilitation Tips
- Use realistic dollar amounts and policy terms
- Compare multiple plans under different usage scenarios
- Ask students to predict costs before revealing calculations
- Highlight the decision-making process, not just the math

#### Example Analysis
- **Health Insurance Plan Comparison**
  - Key points to emphasize: Consider both monthly premiums and potential out-of-pocket costs
  - Discussion questions: "Which plan would be best for someone who rarely uses healthcare services? Which would be best for someone with a chronic condition?"

- **Auto Insurance Deductible Decision**
  - Key points to emphasize: Higher deductibles lower premiums but increase potential out-of-pocket costs
  - Discussion questions: "How would your emergency fund affect your deductible choice? What other factors might influence your decision?"

#### Extension Activity
Have students create their own comparison scenario for home, auto, or health insurance with realistic numbers and analyze which option would be best for different types of consumers.

### Skill Builder Activity

#### Activity Overview
The Insurance Cost Calculator is the cornerstone of Day 1 content and connects directly to Day 2 learning activities. This hands-on calculation exercise helps students translate knowledge into practical skills by walking through real-world insurance scenarios.

**Key Connection**: This Skill Builder specifically connects to the Day 2 Learning Lab by establishing the fundamental calculation methods that will be expanded upon in the Comprehensive Insurance Plan Comparison and Cost-Saving Strategy Evaluation activities. The work students complete here will be directly built upon during the Learning Lab.

#### Activity Objectives
- Calculate total out-of-pocket costs in various insurance scenarios
- Apply understanding of deductibles, co-insurance, and co-payments to real situations
- Analyze how different insurance components affect total costs
- Make informed decisions based on calculations and personal preferences

#### Step-by-Step Facilitation
1. **Introduction (2-3 min)**: Introduce the scenario: a medical bill with a policy having a $500 deductible, 20% co-insurance, and $2,000 co-insurance cap.
2. **Instructions & Examples (3-5 min)**: Walk through the calculation process step-by-step using a simple example. Emphasize the sequential nature of insurance payments.
3. **Individual/Group Work (5-8 min)**: Have students work through the main scenario ($8,000 medical bill) using the worksheet.
4. **Progress Check (1-2 min)**: Check a few students' work to ensure they're on the right track. Address common errors.
5. **Continued Work (5-8 min)**: Have students calculate additional scenarios with varying deductibles and medical bills.
6. **Sharing & Discussion (3-5 min)**: Discuss results and what they reveal about insurance cost relationships.
7. **Connection to Day 2 (1-2 min)**: Preview how students will expand on these calculations in the Day 2 Learning Lab with comprehensive plan comparisons.

#### Common Challenges & Solutions
- **Challenge**: Students struggle to start the calculation process
  - **Solution**: Provide a clear step-by-step template showing the order of operations (deductible first, then co-insurance up to the cap)
- **Challenge**: Wide variation in completion time
  - **Solution**: Have extension scenarios ready for quick finishers and provide calculation aids for those who need more support
- **Challenge**: Confusion about when co-insurance applies
  - **Solution**: Create a visual timeline showing the sequence of payments in a claim
- **Challenge**: Technical issues with digital calculators
  - **Solution**: Have physical calculators as backup and check that all students can access the necessary tools

#### Differentiation Strategies
- **For Students Who Need Support**:
  - Provide a partially completed calculation template
  - Offer a simplified scenario with round numbers

  - Analyze break-even points between different plans
  - Compare total costs over multiple years with different usage patterns

#### Examples & Models
- **Basic Example**: A student correctly calculates a scenario with a $500 deductible and 20% co-insurance on a $2,500 bill: $500 deductible + (20% × $2,000) = $500 + $400 = $900 total out-of-pocket cost.
- **Exemplary Example**: A student analyzes multiple scenarios, identifies patterns in how deductibles and co-insurance affect total costs, and creates a decision framework explaining when different insurance structures are most advantageous.

#### Connection to Day 2
The Skill Builder activity is directly connected to the Day 2 Learning Lab and serves as essential preparation. Make these connections explicit to students:
- Day 2, Station 1 builds on the calculation method learned in the Skill Builder
- Day 2, Station 2 expands the comparison concept to evaluate multiple plans
- Day 2, Stations 3 and 4 apply these calculations to strategy development
- The Skill Builder will be referenced during the Day 2 portfolio development

**Important**: Ensure students save their Skill Builder work, as they will need it for Day 2 activities. Either have them submit digitally or keep physical copies in a secure location.

#### Assessment Guidance
When reviewing student work on the Skill Builder activity, look for:
- Correct calculation sequence (deductible first, then co-insurance, respect caps)
- Accurate math in all scenarios
- Understanding of how different components affect total costs
- Appropriate decision-making based on calculations
- Thorough completion of all worksheet sections

**Assessment Note**: This Skill Builder is a formative assessment opportunity. Provide feedback that will help students improve for Day 2 rather than focusing on grading.

## Discussion Prompts

### For Introduction:
"What factors do you think determine how much you pay for insurance?"
**Expected responses**: Age, health status, driving record, value of items being insured, location, past claims, coverage amount.

### For Key Concepts:
"How do you think insurance companies decide on the balance between premiums and deductibles?"
**Expected responses**: Higher risk individuals pay higher premiums; companies need to collect enough in premiums to cover likely claims; lower deductibles mean higher premiums because the company pays sooner.

### For Deeper Exploration:
"When might it make financial sense to choose a high-deductible plan with lower premiums?"
**Expected responses**: When you have a substantial emergency fund; when you're healthy and rarely use insurance; when you're trying to minimize monthly expenses; when you can pair it with an HSA for tax advantages.
