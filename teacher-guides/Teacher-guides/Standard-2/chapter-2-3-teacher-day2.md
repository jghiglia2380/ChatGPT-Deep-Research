- Ask students to recall 2-3 key points from Day 1 about who needs to file taxes
- Have them quickly review their Tax Documentation Scavenger Hunt results from Day 1
- Briefly explain the Learning Lab structure and objectives for today
- Connect today's activities to real-world application by asking: "How could having a clear process for determining tax filing requirements help you in the future?"

**Facilitation Tip**: Use the warm-up to gauge retention from Day 1 and identify any major misconceptions that need addressing before students begin building their decision trees.

### Activity 1: Building a Tax Filing Decision Tree (20 minutes)

#### Setup & Introduction
- Introduce the concept of a decision tree as a tool for making complex decisions through a series of yes/no questions
- Display a simple example of a decision tree for another topic to illustrate the structure
- Walk through the digital tool interface, showing students how to create nodes and connections
- Explain that their decision tree should help determine whether someone needs to file taxes based on factors like income, filing status, age, and dependency status
- Share the basic starting structure that all trees should include

#### During the Activity
- Encourage students to start by mapping out the major decision points (income thresholds, filing status, dependency status, etc.) before adding detail
- Remind students to refer to their notes from Day 1 and the provided reference materials
- Circulate and check that students are creating logical flow in their decision trees
- Encourage students to test their decision trees with simple scenarios to verify accuracy
- Prompt students to include special situations like self-employment income or situations where filing is beneficial even if not required

#### Group Sharing
- Have a few students share their decision tree structure with the class
- Ask volunteers to explain their approach to organizing the decision points
- Discuss different ways students chose to structure similar information
- Highlight particularly effective or creative approaches

#### Key Questions to Pose:
- "What was your first decision point in your tree, and why did you choose to start there?"
- "How did you handle the different filing statuses in your decision tree?"
- "Where did you include information about filing even when not required?"
- "How might you need to update your decision tree in the future as tax laws change?"

### Activity 2: Case Study Analysis (15 minutes)
