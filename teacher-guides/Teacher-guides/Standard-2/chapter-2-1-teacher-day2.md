## Detailed Facilitation Notes

### Warm-up & Review (5 minutes)

- Begin class by playing the podcast recap of key concepts from Day 1
- While the podcast plays, distribute any materials needed for the day's activities
- After the podcast, briefly clarify any questions students have about tax concepts
- Give a quick overview of the Learning Lab activities and objectives for the day
- Connect today's activities to the Tax System Analysis completed on Day 1

**Facilitation Tip**: Observe student reactions during the podcast to identify who might need additional support. Note any concepts that seem to cause confusion for follow-up during the activities.

### Activity 1: Tax Impact Calculator (15 minutes)

#### Setup & Introduction
- Introduce the Tax Impact Calculator as a tool to see how taxes affect take-home pay
- Demonstrate the calculator with a simple example: $50,000 salary in your state
- Show how to enter different income levels and select different states
- Explain how the results break down federal, state, and FICA taxes
- Connect this activity to the progressive taxation concepts from Day 1

#### During the Activity
- Have students use the calculator to explore at least three scenarios:
  - Their expected starting salary in their home state
  - The same salary in two other states (one with no income tax, one with high income tax)
  - A significantly higher salary to see how progressive taxation affects take-home pay
- Circulate to help students who are having trouble with the calculator
- Encourage students to note surprising findings or significant differences
- Guide students to think about the "why" behind the numbers they're seeing

#### Group Sharing
- After individual exploration, ask 2-3 students to share insights:
  - What surprised them most about the calculations?
  - Which state yielded the highest take-home pay and why?
  - How did the tax burden change as income increased?
- Address any misconceptions that emerge from student responses
- Summarize key takeaways about how tax structure impacts take-home pay

#### Key Questions to Pose:
- "What percentage of your expected starting salary would go to taxes in our state?"
- "How does the overall tax burden change as income increases?"
- "If you were offered the same job in Texas (no income tax) versus California (high income tax), how would your take-home pay differ?"
- "Beyond income tax, what other tax considerations might impact your financial situation?"

### Activity 2: State Tax Comparison Project (15 minutes)

#### Setup & Introduction
- Explain that income tax is just one component of a state's overall tax structure
- Introduce the State Tax Comparison Research Guide and its purpose
- Direct students to select three states to research in detail:
  - One with no state income tax (e.g., Texas, Florida, Nevada)
  - One with a flat tax rate (e.g., Illinois, Michigan)
  - One with progressive tax brackets (e.g., California, New York)
- Review reliable sources for tax information (state government websites, Tax Foundation, etc.)
- Set clear expectations for what information students should gather

#### During the Activity
- Guide students to research and record:
  - Income tax structure and rates
  - Average property tax rates
  - State and local sales tax rates
  - Any unique taxes or fees specific to each state
- Encourage students to think about how these different taxes might affect residents
- Remind students to consider how different taxes affect various income levels and lifestyles
- Challenge advanced students to incorporate cost of living differences in their analysis

#### Support Strategies
- Provide a list of reliable tax information sources for students who are struggling with research
- Have pre-compiled basic information sheets for common states to assist struggling students
- Suggest that students with similar state selections collaborate on data gathering
- Create a quick reference guide with key stats for the most commonly selected states

#### Monitoring Points:
- Check that students are researching beyond just income tax rates
- Ensure students are recording their findings in a clear, organized manner
- Watch for oversimplified conclusions (e.g., "no income tax is always better")
- Guide students toward considering the complete tax picture and various life situations

### Activity 3: Tax Planning Scenario (10 minutes)

#### Setup & Introduction
- Present the scenario: "You've been offered the same job in two different states with significantly different tax structures."
- Distribute the Tax Planning Scenario Worksheet
- Explain that students will use their research and calculator results to:
  - Compare take-home pay in each location
  - Consider other tax impacts beyond income
  - Evaluate non-tax factors that might influence their decision
- Emphasize that the goal is not just to maximize take-home pay but to make a well-reasoned decision

#### During the Activity
- Have students select two states from their research (ideally with contrasting tax approaches)
- Guide them to apply their research findings to the specific scenario
- Encourage students to consider both immediate tax impacts and long-term implications
- Remind students that tax considerations are important but shouldn't be the only factor in location decisions

#### Discussion Prompts:
- "How much difference in take-home pay would make you choose one location over another?"
- "What non-tax factors might outweigh tax advantages in your decision?"
- "How might your tax situation change over time in these locations if your income increases?"
- "What lifestyle factors might affect how different taxes impact you personally?"

**Guidance Note**: Emphasize that there's no universally "right" answer to this scenario. The quality of the analysis and reasoning is more important than the final choice.

### Portfolio Building & Reflection (10 minutes)

#### Portfolio Completion
- Introduce the My Tax Strategy portfolio template
- Explain that this will synthesize what they've learned into a personal tax planning approach
- Guide students to complete their tax strategy, incorporating:
  - Insights from the Tax Impact Calculator
  - Research findings from the State Comparison Project
  - Analysis from the Tax Planning Scenario
  - Reflection on how taxes might impact their career and location decisions
- Emphasize that this portfolio item can be a practical reference for future financial planning

#### Sharing Insights
- If time allows, invite 2-3 volunteers to briefly share a key insight from their tax strategy
- Encourage students to explain how their understanding of taxes has evolved
- Highlight particularly thoughtful or nuanced strategies as models

#### Closing Message:
Remind students that tax knowledge is a practical financial skill that will serve them throughout their lives. Taxes will influence career decisions, housing choices, retirement planning, and more. The analysis skills they've practiced today can help them navigate changing tax situations and make more informed financial decisions.

## Differentiation Strategies

### For Advanced Students
- Challenge them to incorporate additional factors like tax deductions, credits, and exemptions
- Suggest researching how specific industries or professions might be treated differently under various tax codes
- Ask them to analyze how changes in tax policy might affect their strategy
- Encourage them to create a multi-year tax planning model that accounts for career progression
- Have them evaluate how tax strategies might change for different life situations (single, married, with children, etc.)

### For Struggling Students
- Provide partially completed worksheets with key information filled in
- Offer a simplified version of the State Comparison with fewer data points to research
- Allow students to work collaboratively on research and calculations
- Provide step-by-step guides for using the Tax Impact Calculator
- Focus their analysis on just one or two key tax differences rather than comprehensive research
- Use simplified scenarios with rounded numbers for easier calculations

### For ELL Students
- Pair visual representations with tax concepts
- Provide glossaries of tax terms with simple definitions
- Allow use of translation tools for research
- Offer sentence frames for completing reflection responses
- Create visual flowcharts of tax calculation processes
- Use examples that minimize cultural references that might be unfamiliar

## Assessment Strategies

### Formative Assessment
- Observe student engagement and understanding during the podcast recap
- Monitor student use of the Tax Impact Calculator for accuracy and application
