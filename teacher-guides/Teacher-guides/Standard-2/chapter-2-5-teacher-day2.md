- Check for understanding with quick 2-3 questions after the podcast
- Address any lingering questions or misconceptions from Day 1
- Preview the Learning Lab activities and explain how they build on the Tax Planning Checklist
- Emphasize that the Learning Lab is focused on practical application of tax planning concepts

**Facilitation Tip**: While students listen to the podcast, observe their engagement and note any concepts that might need reinforcement during the simulation and portfolio activities.

### Tax Strategy Simulation (15 minutes)

#### Setup & Introduction
- Explain that students will be assigned one of four personas to simulate tax planning decisions:
  - **College Student**: Part-time job, education expenses, limited income
  - **Recent Graduate**: Entry-level job, student loan debt, renting apartment
  - **Young Professional**: Higher income, considering home purchase, retirement planning
  - **New Parent**: Dual income, new child, childcare expenses, home ownership
- Assign personas using your preferred method (random, student choice, etc.)
- Explain that each student will make decisions for their persona through three simulated years
- Clarify that the goal is to implement effective tax planning strategies and see their impact over time

#### During the Activity
- Guide students to access their assigned persona in the simulation
- Remind students to read all information carefully before making decisions
- Encourage students to take notes on their reasoning for each decision
- Emphasize the importance of considering both short-term and long-term impacts
- Circulate to assist students who have questions or need clarification
- Monitor for common misunderstandings and address them in real time
- Provide time warnings at the halfway point and with two minutes remaining

#### Group Sharing
- As students finish the simulation, have them note their final outcomes
- Prepare for the debrief by arranging students with different personas into small groups
- Encourage students to compare strategies and outcomes across different life stages

#### Key Questions to Pose:
- "How did you approach the decision-making process for your persona?"
- "Which tax planning strategy seemed most effective for your persona's situation?"
- "Were you surprised by any of the outcomes of your decisions?"
- "How did your persona's life stage influence which strategies were most beneficial?"

### Simulation Debrief (5 minutes)

- Facilitate small group discussions among students with different personas
- Have each group identify one key insight about how tax planning needs differ across life stages
- Use a quick whiteboard or digital chart to capture key strategies for each life stage
- Highlight strategies that were universally beneficial across all personas
- Point out strategies that were particularly effective for specific life stages
- Connect simulation insights back to the core tax planning strategies from Day 1
- Emphasize how proactive planning yielded better results than reactive approaches

**Facilitation Tip**: Use a "round robin" approach where each group quickly shares one insight to keep the debrief moving efficiently while still capturing diverse perspectives.
