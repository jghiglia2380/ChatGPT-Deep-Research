## Detailed Facilitation Notes

### Warm-up & Review (5 minutes)

- Play the Tax Ethics Podcast (5-7 minutes) which reviews key concepts from Day 1:
  - Progressive taxation principles
  - Marginal vs. effective tax rates
  - Tax bracket calculations
  - Tax avoidance vs. tax evasion distinction
- After listening, ask 2-3 students to share one key concept they remember from Day 1
- Briefly address any questions about Day 1 content before proceeding
- Connect the podcast content to today's exploration of tax ethics and policy impacts
- Remind students that their Day 1 Skill Builder responses will be relevant for today's activities

**Facilitation Tip**: If time is limited, focus the review specifically on the tax avoidance vs. evasion distinction, as this most directly connects to the ethics explorations in today's Learning Lab.

### Activity 1: Tax Ethics Research Challenge (15 minutes)

#### Setup & Introduction
- Divide students into predetermined groups of 3-4

  - Group 4: State tax competition
  - Group 5: International tax havens
  - Group 6: Mortgage interest deduction
- Explain that each group will analyze their assigned topic from multiple perspectives
- Distribute or provide digital access to research resources for each topic

#### During the Activity
- Guide students to analyze their topic using these key questions:
  - How does this policy/strategy work?
  - Who benefits from this policy/strategy?
  - Who might be disadvantaged?
  - What are the broader societal impacts?
  - What are arguments for and against this policy?
- Circulate among groups to ensure they're considering multiple perspectives
- Remind students to document their findings in the digital research template
- Provide supplementary resources for groups that finish quickly

#### Group Sharing
- Have each group prepare a 60-second summary of their findings
- Call on 2-3 groups to briefly share their analysis with the class
- Encourage other students to note connections between different tax policies
- If time permits, ask groups to identify one surprising insight from their research

#### Key Questions to Pose:
- "How does your tax policy or strategy affect government revenue?"
- "What values or principles seem to underlie this tax policy?"
- "Do you think this policy achieves its intended purpose? Why or why not?"
- "How might changes to this policy affect different stakeholders?"

### Activity 2: Tax Impact Analysis (15 minutes)

  - Remind them to consider implementation challenges and responses to counterarguments
  - Suggest they reference specific findings from their tax impact analysis

- For the Tax Ethics Position Statement:
  - Prompt students to reflect on their Day 1 Skill Builder responses
  - Guide them to articulate their definition of ethical tax behavior
  - Encourage consideration of the balance between minimization and social responsibility
  - Help them connect taxation to broader social values and public goods
  - Remind them to reference specific examples from their research and analysis

#### Discussion Prompts:
- "How has your understanding of taxation evolved through this exploration?"
- "What tensions exist between different values in tax policy (e.g., efficiency, fairness, simplicity)?"
- "How do you balance individual rights to minimize tax burden with social responsibilities?"
- "What principles should guide tax policy development in your view?"

**Guidance Note**: Emphasize that there are legitimate differences of opinion on many tax policy questions. The quality of reasoning and evidence matters more than specific positions. Encourage civil discourse that respects diverse perspectives.

### Reflection & Portfolio Integration (10 minutes)

- Demonstrate how to use the Portfolio Integration System to organize these elements
- Suggest ways to highlight connections between different components

#### Sharing Insights
- Ask 3-5 students to briefly share one key insight from their experience
- Prompt students to reflect on how their understanding of taxation has evolved
- Encourage students to identify how this learning connects to their personal financial planning
- Have students complete a brief written reflection addressing:
  - How their perspective on taxation has changed
  - How this understanding will influence their financial decisions
  - What questions they still have about taxation

#### Closing Message:
Understanding how taxes work—from the mechanics of tax brackets to the ethical dimensions of tax policy—is an essential component of financial literacy. The knowledge you've gained helps you make more informed financial decisions, evaluate policy proposals critically, and understand your role in supporting public goods and services. As you progress through your financial journey, this foundation will help you navigate tax decisions responsibly and thoughtfully.
