## Detailed Facilitation Notes

### Warm-Up: Housing Priorities Reflection (5 minutes)

- Begin by asking students to review their Housing Priorities Comparison Chart from Day 1
- Use the discussion questions to help students reconnect with the content:
  - "What were your top three housing priorities? Why are these important to you?"
  - "Did you discover any surprising insights about your housing preferences?"
  - "How might your priorities change as you progress through different life stages?"
- Create a quick visual representation of class priorities (e.g., word cloud or tally chart)
- Explain how today's activities will build on these priorities to create practical tools for housing decisions

**Facilitation Tip**: For students who were absent or didn't complete the Day 1 activity, have extra copies of the Housing Priorities Comparison Chart available and allow a few minutes for them to identify their priorities before proceeding.

### Activity 1: Housing Costs Calculator (15 minutes)

#### Setup & Introduction
- Direct students to the Housing Costs Calculator (online tool or printed worksheet)
- Explain that this tool will help them compare the true financial implications of renting vs. buying
- Briefly review the input variables for both the rental and purchase scenarios
- Clarify potentially confusing concepts like appreciation rates, property tax calculations, and mortgage amortization
- Demonstrate how to input data and interpret the results with a simple example

#### During the Activity
- Have students work individually or in pairs to complete the sample scenario:
  - Rental inputs: $1,200 monthly rent, 3% annual increase, $15 monthly insurance, $150 monthly utilities
  - Purchase inputs: $250,000 home, 10% down payment, 4.5% interest rate, 30-year term, 1.2% property tax, etc.
- After completing the sample scenario, instruct students to experiment with different variables:
  - Change the down payment amount to see its impact
  - Adjust the appreciation rate
  - Modify the anticipated length of stay
- Circulate to assist with calculations and interpretations
- Encourage students to try scenarios that might reflect their future situations

#### Key Questions to Pose:
- "What happens to the comparison when you extend the time horizon from 5 years to 10 years?"
- "Which variable seems to have the biggest impact on whether renting or buying is more cost-effective?"
- "How does changing the down payment amount affect the monthly payment and total cost?"
- "At what point (how many years) does buying become more cost-effective than renting in your scenario?"

**Facilitation Tip**: If technology access is limited, provide pre-calculated examples showing how changing different variables affects the outcomes. Focus on interpretation rather than calculation.

### Activity 2: Housing Application Requirements Comparison (10 minutes)

#### Setup & Introduction
- Organize students into small groups of 3-4
- Distribute the Housing Application Requirements Comparison chart
- Explain that understanding qualification requirements is essential for planning ahead
- Review the categories in the comparison chart: credit score, income requirements, employment history, etc.
- Assign each group to focus on either rental requirements or mortgage qualification requirements
  
#### During the Activity
- Provide resource materials or direct students to reliable online sources
- For groups researching rental requirements:
  - Provide sample rental applications
  - Share typical landlord screening criteria
  - Include information about rental history, income verification, etc.
  
- For groups researching mortgage requirements:
  - Provide information about different loan types (conventional, FHA, VA)
  - Include debt-to-income ratio guidelines
  - Share credit score impacts on interest rates
  
- After 5 minutes of research, pair rental and mortgage groups to share findings and complete the full comparison
- Have groups create "Financial Preparation Checklists" for both short-term (rental) and long-term (purchase) goals

#### Group Sharing
- Ask each paired group to share one key difference they identified
- Create a master comparison chart incorporating insights from all groups
- Discuss the reasons behind the differences in requirements
- Highlight actionable steps students can take to prepare for either option

#### Key Questions to Pose:
- "What are the most significant differences in requirements between renting and buying?"
- "Which option has more stringent qualification requirements? Why do you think that is?"
- "What steps could a young adult take now to improve their ability to qualify for housing in the future?"
- "How might someone with credit challenges improve their housing options?"

**Facilitation Tip**: If possible, invite a mortgage lender or real estate professional as a guest speaker to provide authentic insights about qualification requirements and preparation strategies.

### Activity 3: Housing Scenario Analysis (10 minutes)

#### Setup & Introduction
- Distribute the Housing Scenario Analysis worksheets
- Review the three scenarios: Recent College Graduate, Mid-Career Family, and Pre-Retirement Planning
- Explain the decision matrix rating system (1-5 scale, where 1 strongly favors renting and 5 strongly favors buying)
- Model how to rate one factor for a scenario, explaining your reasoning
- Clarify that the goal is not just to calculate a "score" but to think critically about how different factors interact

#### During the Activity
- Have students work in pairs or small groups to analyze all three scenarios
- Instruct them to:
  - Rate each factor on the 1-5 scale for each scenario
  - Provide brief explanations for each rating
  - Calculate the total score
  - Determine the recommended housing option based on the analysis
- Circulate to ask probing questions and guide analysis
- Encourage students to consider both financial and non-financial factors

#### Discussion Prompts:
- "How did life stage impact the housing recommendation for each scenario?"
- "What factors seemed most important in determining the best option?"
- "Were there any scenarios where the decision was particularly close or difficult?"
- "How might personal preferences change the recommendation, even with the same financial situation?"

**Guidance Note**: Emphasize that this analysis demonstrates how housing decisions are affected by life stage, stability, financial readiness, and future plans. The "right" answer may differ between students even for the same scenario, depending on what factors they weigh most heavily.

### Activity 4: Personal Housing Plan Development (10 minutes)

#### Setup & Introduction
- Transition from analyzing fictional scenarios to personal application
- Distribute the Personal Housing Plan template
- Review each section of the plan:
  - Current Housing Profile (current situation, resources, priorities)
  - Housing Goals (short-term, medium-term, long-term)
  - Housing Action Plan (financial preparation, timeline, research needed)
  - Challenges and Solutions (obstacles and strategies)
- Emphasize that plans should be realistic and based on actual circumstances

#### During the Activity
- Allow students to work independently on their personal housing plans
- For students uncomfortable sharing personal information, offer the option to create a plan for a fictional person similar to themselves
- Encourage students to be specific about:
  - Current financial resources and constraints
  - Concrete financial goals and timelines
  - Specific action steps for preparation
  - Realistic challenges they might face
- Circulate to provide individual guidance and encouragement
- For students who finish early, suggest they add more detail to their action plans or research local housing options

#### Support Strategies
- Provide sentence starters for students who struggle with getting started
- Post a word bank of potential goals, action steps, and challenges
- Have exemplar plans available for reference
- Offer guided questions to help students think through each section

#### Monitoring Points:
- Check that short-term goals are realistic and achievable
- Ensure action plans include specific, measurable steps
- Look for thoughtful consideration of personal circumstances
- Watch for unrealistic expectations about housing costs or qualification requirements

### Portfolio Project Introduction & Wrap-Up (5 minutes)

#### Portfolio Project Introduction
- Introduce the Housing Market Analysis portfolio project

  - Financial comparison between renting and buying
  - Analysis of local housing trends
  - Personalized recommendation based on individual circumstances
- Distribute the Housing Market Research Guide
- Set clear expectations and timelines for completion

#### Closing Reflection
- Guide students through the final reflection questions:
  - "What was the most surprising insight you gained from today's activities?"
  - "How has your thinking about renting versus buying evolved since our previous class?"
  - "What specific actions will you take to prepare for future housing decisions?"
- Have a few students share their key takeaways
- Summarize the main points from both days:
  - Both renting and buying have advantages and disadvantages
  - The best choice depends on personal circumstances, priorities, and goals
  - Housing needs evolve throughout different life stages
  - Financial preparation is essential for both renting and buying
  - Informed decisions require analyzing multiple factors beyond just monthly cost
