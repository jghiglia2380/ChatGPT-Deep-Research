## Detailed Facilitation Notes

### Warm-up & Review (5 minutes)

- Direct students to review their rental priorities reflection from Day 1
- Facilitate a brief discussion using the discussion questions:
  - "What common priorities did we identify as a class?"
  - "How might priorities change as life circumstances change?"
  - "How do priorities affect housing budgets?"
- Use this discussion to activate prior knowledge and connect to today's activities
- Preview the learning lab structure and expectations for each activity

**Facilitation Tip**: Create a quick visual representation of class priorities by asking students to briefly share their top priority and noting trends. This reinforces the diversity of needs while identifying common concerns.

### Activity 1: Lease Agreement Analysis (12 minutes)

#### Setup & Introduction
- Distribute sample lease agreement and analysis worksheets
- Briefly review the seven key components of leases from Day 1:
  1. Names and addresses
  2. Rent details
  3. Security deposit information
  4. Lease duration
  5. Policies and rules
  6. Utilities and services
  7. Entry rights
- Explain that students will examine the lease to identify:
  - Basic lease terms
  - Tenant and landlord responsibilities
  - Potentially problematic clauses
  - Questions to ask before signing
  - Possible negotiation points
- Model the analysis process with one section of the lease

#### During the Activity
- Circulate to check understanding and provide guidance
- Prompt students with guiding questions if they're struggling:
  - "What does this clause require you to do?"
  - "How might this term become a problem later?"
  - "Is this requirement reasonable and legal?"
  - "What clarification would you need about this term?"
- Encourage students to identify both protective clauses and concerning ones
- Note common issues students identify for discussion

#### Group Sharing
- Call time after 7-8 minutes of analysis
- Ask several students to share concerning clauses they identified
- Discuss how these clauses could be renegotiated or clarified
- Highlight commonly overlooked issues in leases that students may have missed
- Emphasize the importance of understanding every aspect of a lease before signing

#### Key Questions to Pose:
- "Which clause would you most want to negotiate or clarify? Why?"
- "What additional terms or protections would you want added to this lease?"
- "What questions would you ask the landlord before signing this lease?"
- "How might this lease create problems for tenants in certain situations?"

### Activity 2: True Cost of Renting Calculator (12 minutes)

#### Setup & Introduction
- Distribute rental cost calculator worksheets with the three scenarios
- Review the different categories of rental costs:
  - Upfront costs (security deposit, application fees, first/last month's rent, etc.)
  - Monthly recurring costs (rent, utilities, parking, insurance, etc.)
  - Annualized costs and financial impact scenarios
- Explain that students should calculate:
  - Total upfront costs needed to move in
  - Total monthly expenses beyond rent
  - Annual cost of renting (monthly Ã— 12 + one-time costs)
  - Impact of specific scenarios (breaking lease, roommate leaving, rent increase)
- Demonstrate a simple calculation with the first few items of Scenario 1

#### During the Activity
- Encourage students to use calculators or spreadsheet tools
- Provide assistance with calculations as needed
- Remind students to consider all costs mentioned in the scenarios
- Challenge advanced students to identify additional potential costs not explicitly stated
- Check for mathematical errors in calculations

#### Support Strategies
- Provide formula references for students struggling with calculations
- Allow collaboration for students who need support
- Have a partially completed example available for reference
- Offer step-by-step guidance for complex calculations
- Use consistent calculation methods across all scenarios

#### Monitoring Points:
- Check that students are calculating both upfront and monthly costs
- Ensure students understand the 30% housing guideline and can apply it
- Verify students are considering all utilities and fees, not just rent
- Monitor for common calculation errors or misconceptions
- Note if students are making connections between costs and their own future plans

### Activity 3: Tenant Rights and Responsibilities Simulation (10 minutes)

#### Setup & Introduction
- Organize students into pairs or small groups
- Assign each group one scenario to analyze (or let them choose)
- Review the key tenant rights and responsibilities from Day 1
- Explain that for each scenario, groups should identify:
  - Specific tenant rights that apply

#### During the Activity
- Circulate to provide guidance and answer questions
- Remind students to think about proper documentation and communication
- Encourage groups to consider multiple approaches to resolution
- Prompt groups to consider the legal basis for their responses
- Challenge groups to draft specific language for communications

#### Discussion Prompts:
- "What documentation would be important in this situation?"
- "What is the most appropriate first step in this scenario?"
- "How might the outcome differ if the tenant doesn't understand their rights?"
- "What preventive measures could have avoided this situation?"
- "How would you communicate effectively with the landlord in this case?"

**Guidance Note**: Provide local tenant rights resources if available, as laws vary by state and locality. Emphasize that while general principles apply nationwide, specific protections may differ based on location.

### Activity 4: Rental Readiness Plan (10 minutes)

#### Setup & Introduction
- Distribute rental readiness plan templates
- Explain that this activity helps students prepare concretely for future renting
- Review the four components of the rental readiness plan:

  3. Rental Search Strategy (priorities and process)
  4. Move-In Preparation Checklist (application and setup)
- Emphasize that plans should be personalized based on individual circumstances, priorities, and timelines
- Remind students to incorporate insights from previous activities

#### During the Activity
- Encourage students to be realistic about their current situation and future needs
- Prompt them to set specific financial goals for rental preparation
- Remind them to reference their priority list from Day 1
- Suggest they consider both short-term and long-term housing plans
- Help them identify appropriate resources for their search process

#### Discussion Prompts:
- "What timeline are you considering for your first independent rental?"
- "What financial preparations would you need to make before renting?"
- "Which aspects of rental readiness do you feel most/least prepared for?"
- "How might your rental priorities and budget change over the next 3-5 years?"
- "What additional information or resources would help you prepare?"

**Guidance Note**: For students who may not be planning to rent in the near future, suggest they create a plan for a hypothetical scenario (e.g., moving for college or a job) or for a friend or family member. The skills transfer regardless of personal circumstances.

#### Success Indicators
- **Excellent Work**: Demonstrates comprehensive understanding of lease components with nuanced analysis of potential issues; calculates all rental costs with precision and identifies hidden expenses; develops sophisticated strategies for tenant-landlord situations; creates detailed, personalized rental readiness plan with specific action steps; produces thorough research and analysis of rental options with insightful justifications for recommendations.

- **Proficient Work**: Shows adequate understanding of main lease components and identifies obvious issues; accurately calculates basic rental costs across scenarios; develops appropriate responses to tenant-landlord situations; creates reasonable rental readiness plan addressing key preparation areas; conducts basic research on rental options with logical recommendations based on priorities and budget.

- **Needs Improvement**: Shows limited analysis of lease components with minimal issue identification; makes errors in basic cost calculations; develops simplistic or inappropriate responses to tenant-landlord situations; creates incomplete rental readiness plan lacking specificity; conducts superficial research on rental options with recommendations lacking clear justification or connection to priorities.

**Recommendation**: Evaluate both the process (engagement in learning lab activities) and products (completed worksheets, calculations, plans, and final portfolio project). The rental housing portfolio should demonstrate students' ability to apply knowledge to practical housing decisions they will face in the near future.
