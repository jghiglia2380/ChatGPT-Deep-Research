- Welcome students and briefly review key concepts from Day 1: home buying process, mortgage types, and true costs of homeownership
- Ask 2-3 students to share one key insight from their Homeownership Readiness Evaluation
- Create a mind map on the board showing how life changes can affect housing needs and choices
- Provide an overview of today's Learning Lab structure and explain how the four stations build toward the portfolio project
- Emphasize that these activities are valuable even for students who don't plan to buy a home for many years

**Facilitation Tip**: Begin with a quick reflection moment: "Thinking about yesterday's lesson, what aspect of home buying seemed most complex or surprising to you?" This helps you gauge which concepts may need reinforcement during today's activities.

### Station 1: Mortgage Option Analysis (12 minutes)

#### Setup & Introduction
- Direct students to the Mortgage Option Analysis worksheets
- Explain that they will analyze four different buyer profiles and match them with the most appropriate mortgage type
- Review the five main mortgage types discussed in Day 1 (Conventional, FHA, VA, USDA, Jumbo)
- Emphasize that there is rarely a single "right" answer—the goal is to justify their selections with sound reasoning

#### During the Activity
- Model the analysis process for the first buyer profile through a think-aloud approach
- Encourage students to consider multiple factors: down payment savings, credit score, location, military status, and financial stability
- Remind students to include interest rate, loan term, and down payment amount in their recommendations
- Circulate to provide guidance and ask probing questions about their selections

#### Group Sharing
- After about 8-10 minutes, call on a few students to share their recommendations for different profiles
- Encourage respectful debate when students make different recommendations for the same profile
- Highlight particularly thoughtful justifications that consider both short-term affordability and long-term implications
- Summarize key factors that influence mortgage selection

#### Key Questions to Pose:
- "How does a buyer's down payment amount affect their mortgage options?"
- "Why might an FHA loan be better than a conventional loan for some buyers?"
- "What are the trade-offs between a 15-year and 30-year mortgage term?"
- "How might a buyer's future plans affect which mortgage option is best for them?"

### Station 2: True Cost of Homeownership Calculator (12 minutes)

#### Setup & Introduction
- Direct students to the True Cost of Homeownership Calculator tool
- Remind students of the iceberg metaphor—many homeownership costs are hidden beneath the surface
- Explain the three categories of costs: upfront costs, ongoing costs, and hidden/unexpected costs
- Demonstrate how to use the calculator with a simple example

#### During the Activity
- Have students calculate the total monthly and annual costs for a hypothetical home purchase
- Encourage them to create "what if" scenarios by adjusting variables like home price, interest rate, property taxes, and maintenance costs
- Guide students to calculate the total cost of homeownership over different time periods (5, 10, 30 years)
- Ask students to identify which costs they can control and which are largely fixed

#### Support Strategies
- Provide reference sheets with typical percentages for maintenance costs (1-3% of home value annually)
- Offer local property tax rate information
- For struggling students, provide partially completed calculations
- For advanced students, encourage consideration of opportunity costs of the down payment

#### Monitoring Points:
- Check that students are including all cost categories in their calculations
- Ensure students understand the difference between one-time and recurring costs
- Watch for common calculation errors, especially in long-term projections
- Verify that students are recording their findings for the portfolio project

### Station 3: Property Evaluation Matrix (12 minutes)

#### Setup & Introduction
- Direct students to the Property Evaluation Matrix worksheet
- Explain that this tool helps buyers make objective comparisons between different properties
- Demonstrate how to assign importance weights to different factors (location, size, condition, etc.)
- Show how to score properties on each factor and calculate weighted totals

#### During the Activity
- Have students identify 8-10 factors that would be important to them in a home purchase
- Guide them to assign importance weights to each factor (1-5 scale)
- Provide 2-3 sample property descriptions for students to evaluate using their matrix
- Encourage thoughtful justification of both the weights and scores assigned

#### Discussion Prompts:
- "Which factors did you weight most heavily in your evaluation, and why?"
- "How might your property priorities change at different life stages?"
- "What compromises would you be willing to make when selecting a property?"
- "How does this systematic approach help remove emotion from the property selection process?"

**Guidance Note**: Emphasize that there's no universally "correct" weighting system—the matrix should reflect individual priorities. What's important is that students develop a systematic approach to evaluation that considers multiple factors beyond just emotional reactions to properties.

### Station 4: Home Buying Timeline and Savings Plan (12 minutes)

#### Setup & Introduction
- Direct students to the Home Buying Timeline and Savings Plan worksheet
- Have students reference their Homeownership Readiness Evaluations from Day 1
- Explain that this activity creates a personalized roadmap for improving readiness
- Demonstrate how to set specific, measurable goals for different timeframes

#### During the Activity
- Guide students to identify their target timeframe for potential homeownership
- Help students calculate how much they would need to save for a down payment
- Encourage the creation of specific action steps for improving credit, saving money, and researching housing markets
- Assist students in setting realistic milestone targets for 1-year, 3-year, and 5-year timeframes

#### Monitoring Points:
- Check that timelines reflect realistic assessment of current readiness
- Ensure savings goals are specific and mathematically sound
- Watch for overly optimistic income projections
- Verify that action steps are specific and measurable

#### Discussion Prompts:
- "What is your most important action step for improving homeownership readiness?"
- "How does creating a timeline help make the goal of homeownership more achievable?"
- "What challenges might arise during your timeline, and how could you address them?"
- "How could this timeline approach be useful for other financial goals?"

### Reflection & Wrap-up (5 minutes)

#### Portfolio Integration
- Direct students to compile their work from all four stations into a comprehensive portfolio
- Guide them to write a brief summary that connects their mortgage analysis, cost calculations, property evaluation, and timeline
- Emphasize that this portfolio demonstrates their ability to make informed housing decisions
- Encourage students to revisit and refine their portfolio as circumstances change

#### Sharing Insights
- Ask 2-3 volunteers to share their most valuable insight from today's activities
- Highlight connections between different stations and how they build comprehensive understanding
- Point out how today's activities connect to previous lessons on budgeting, credit, and housing decisions
- Emphasize transferable skills developed (decision matrices, cost analysis, long-term planning)

#### Closing Message:
Whether homeownership is in your near future or many years away, the analytical tools you've developed today will help you make informed decisions about housing and other major purchases. Remember that homeownership is not the right choice for everyone, and timing depends on personal circumstances. The key is to approach the decision with thorough research, careful planning, and a clear understanding of both the financial and lifestyle implications.
