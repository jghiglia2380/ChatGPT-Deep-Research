### Skill Builder Activity

#### Activity Overview
The Check Register Completion activity is the cornerstone of Day 1 content and connects directly to Day 2 learning activities. This hands-on application helps students translate knowledge into practical skills by maintaining a check register, identifying transactions, and reconciling with a bank statement.

**Key Connection**: This Skill Builder specifically connects to the Day 2 Learning Lab by establishing the foundation of transaction tracking that students will build on when creating their personalized banking system plan. The reconciliation skills practiced here will directly inform the Fee Detective activity on Day 2.

#### Activity Objectives
- Practice accurate recording of various transaction types in a check register
- Calculate running balances correctly
- Compare personal records with bank statements
- Identify discrepancies between records and statements
- Develop the habit of regular financial record-keeping

#### Step-by-Step Facilitation
1. **Introduction (2 min)**: Explain the purpose of the check register activity and how it relates to real-world financial management. Show a sample completed check register.
2. **Instructions & Examples (3 min)**: Walk students through the check register template, explaining each column and its purpose. Demonstrate how to record a sample transaction.
3. **Individual Work (5-7 min)**: Have students begin recording transactions from the sample bank statement into their check registers. Encourage them to ask questions as they work.
4. **Progress Check (1 min)**: Check on student progress and address any common issues you observe.
5. **Continued Work (3-5 min)**: Have students complete their check registers and calculate final balances.
6. **Reconciliation (3 min)**: Guide students through comparing their final balance with the bank statement balance, identifying any discrepancies.
7. **Connection to Day 2 (1 min)**: Explain how this skill will be built upon in the Day 2 Learning Lab activities.

#### Common Challenges & Solutions
- **Challenge**: Students struggle with keeping track of the running balance
  - **Solution**: Suggest they double-check their math after each entry or use a calculator
- **Challenge**: Students miss transactions or record them incorrectly
  - **Solution**: Encourage a systematic approach, checking off each transaction on the bank statement as it's recorded
- **Challenge**: Students don't understand certain transaction descriptions
  - **Solution**: Provide a glossary of common transaction descriptions or explain contextually
- **Challenge**: Students find discrepancies but don't know how to resolve them
  - **Solution**: Provide a step-by-step troubleshooting guide for finding errors

#### Differentiation Strategies
- **For Students Who Need Support**:
  - Provide a partially completed check register
  - Simplify the sample bank statement with fewer transactions
  - Create a check register with built-in formulas for calculations
  - Offer step-by-step instructions with visual cues
  - Allow peer assistance for students who struggle with calculations

- **For Advanced Students**:
  - Include more complex transactions in their sample bank statement
  - Add scenarios that require reconciliation of outstanding items
  - Challenge them to identify and categorize spending patterns
  - Ask them to create a monthly budget based on the transaction history
  - Have them investigate digital alternatives to paper check registers

#### Examples & Models
- **Basic Example**: A completed check register showing simple transactions (deposits, withdrawals, debit card purchases) with correct running balances and matching the bank statement balance.
- **Exemplary Example**: A comprehensive check register that includes various transaction types, notes about each transaction, flagged potential fees, identifies spending categories, and includes reconciliation notes for outstanding items.

#### Connection to Day 2
The Skill Builder activity is directly connected to the Day 2 Learning Lab and serves as essential preparation. Make these connections explicit to students:
- Day 2, Banking Tools Challenge will build on their understanding of different transaction types
- Day 2, Fee Detective activity will require them to identify unnecessary fees like those they may have encountered in the check register activity
- Day 2, My Banking System Plan will incorporate the reconciliation process they practiced today

**Important**: Ensure students save their Skill Builder work, as they will need it for Day 2 activities. Either have them submit digitally or keep physical copies in a secure location.

#### Assessment Guidance
When reviewing student work on the Skill Builder activity, look for:
- Accurate recording of all transactions from the bank statement
- Correct calculation of running balances
- Proper identification of different transaction types
