## Detailed Facilitation Notes

### Warm-up & Review (5 minutes)

- Begin by having students listen to the pre-recorded podcast reviewing key banking concepts from Day 1
- The podcast should cover:
  - Overview of primary banking tools (checks, debit cards, ATMs, online banking)
  - Process of account reconciliation
  - Common banking fees and their impact
  - Connection between Day 1 and today's Learning Lab
- After the podcast, quickly check for understanding with 2-3 pointed questions
- Have students take out their completed check registers from Day 1 for reference during today's activities
- Set expectations for active participation in today's hands-on activities

**Facilitation Tip**: If the podcast playback encounters technical issues, be prepared with a quick verbal review of key concepts that covers the same material.

### Activity 1: Banking Tools Challenge (15 minutes)

#### Setup & Introduction
- Explain that students will analyze realistic financial scenarios and select the most appropriate banking tools to use
- Clarify that there may be multiple valid approaches, but some tools are better suited than others for specific situations
- Demonstrate the first scenario as an example, walking through the thought process for selecting a tool
- Emphasize that students should justify their choices with reasoning, not just select a tool

#### During the Activity
- Guide students through a series of 8-10 scenario cards that present different financial situations
- For each scenario, students should:
  - Identify the banking context (payment, deposit, transfer, etc.)
  - Select the most appropriate banking tool
  - Explain their reasoning
  - Consider potential alternatives
- Monitor student progress and provide assistance as needed
- Encourage students to think about factors such as:
  - Speed of transaction processing
  - Security considerations
  - Record-keeping needs
  - Associated fees
  - Convenience

#### Group Sharing
- After students complete the scenarios, facilitate a brief discussion about selected answers
- Focus on scenarios where there might be differing opinions about the best tool
- Ask students to share their reasoning and engage in respectful comparison of approaches
- Highlight how different personal preferences or situations might lead to different tool choices

#### Key Questions to Pose:
- "What factors did you consider when choosing between a debit card and a check?"
- "In what situations might online banking be preferable to visiting an ATM?"
- "How might your banking tool choices change as your financial situation changes?"
- "What security considerations influenced your selections?"

### Activity 2: Fee Detective (15 minutes)

#### Setup & Introduction
- Transition students to the Fee Detective activity, where they'll analyze sample bank statements to identify fees
- Explain that they'll categorize fees as either "avoidable" or "service-based"
- Demonstrate how to identify different types of fees on a bank statement
- Explain that after identifying fees, students will develop strategies to avoid unnecessary charges

#### During the Activity
- Provide students with sample bank statements containing various fees:
  - Maintenance fees
  - ATM fees
  - Overdraft fees
  - Returned check fees
  - Paper statement fees
  - Minimum balance fees
- Guide students to:
  - Highlight all fees on the statement
  - Categorize each fee (avoidable or service-based)
  - Calculate the total monthly fee amount
  - Project the annual cost of these fees
  - Develop specific strategies to avoid each avoidable fee
- Circulate among students to provide guidance and answer questions
- Challenge students to think critically about whether some "service-based" fees might also be avoidable

#### Support Strategies
- Provide a fee identification checklist for students who need additional support
- Offer a fee glossary with descriptions of common banking fees
- Create a guided worksheet for fee analysis for students who need more structure
- Allow collaborative work for students who benefit from discussion

#### Monitoring Points:
- Check that students are correctly identifying all fees on the statements
- Ensure students understand the difference between avoidable and service-based fees
- Monitor for accurate calculation of monthly and projected annual fee totals
- Look for thoughtful, specific strategies for fee avoidance
- Identify students who might need additional guidance on fee identification

### Activity 3: My Banking System Plan (15 minutes)

#### Setup & Introduction
- Transition students to creating their personalized banking system plans
- Explain that effective financial management requires a systematic approach to banking
- Clarify that their plans should reflect their own preferences, needs, and habits
- Show an example of a completed banking system plan with the key components

#### During the Activity
- Guide students to create comprehensive plans that include:
  - Selection of preferred banking tools with rationale
  - Transaction tracking method (digital, paper, or hybrid)
  - Account reconciliation schedule and process
  - Fee avoidance strategies
  - Security measures for banking information
- Encourage students to consider their own spending patterns, income sources, and financial goals
- Remind students to incorporate insights from the previous activities
- Suggest that students create specific rules for themselves (e.g., "I will check my account balance every Monday")
- Emphasize the importance of creating a realistic plan they can actually implement

#### Discussion Prompts:
- "How might your banking system need to change as your financial situation evolves?"
- "What obstacles might prevent you from following your banking system plan, and how could you overcome them?"
- "How does your plan help you avoid the fees we identified in the previous activity?"
- "What role does technology play in your banking system plan?"

**Guidance Note**: Emphasize that there's no single "correct" banking systemâ€”the best plan is one that the student will consistently follow and that meets their specific needs.

### Reflection & Portfolio Integration (5 minutes)

#### Portfolio Completion
- Guide students to compile their work from the Learning Lab into a cohesive portfolio section
- Explain that their portfolio should include:
  - Key insights from the Banking Tools Challenge
  - Fee identification and avoidance strategies from the Fee Detective activity
  - Their personalized Banking System Plan
  - Connections to their Day 1 check register activity
  - Personal reflection on what they learned
- Demonstrate how to organize these components logically
- Emphasize the importance of articulating personal learning and growth

#### Sharing Insights
- Ask 2-3 students to briefly share one key insight from today's Learning Lab
- Encourage students to highlight how their understanding of banking tools has evolved
- Facilitate a quick discussion about how these skills connect to broader financial literacy
- Ask students to identify one specific action they plan to take based on today's learning

#### Closing Message:
Understanding and effectively using banking tools is fundamental to managing your finances successfully. The skills you've developed in selecting appropriate tools, tracking transactions, avoiding fees, and creating systematic approaches to banking will serve you throughout your life. As financial technologies continue to evolve, the principles of careful record-keeping, regular reconciliation, and fee awareness will remain essential to your financial well-being.
