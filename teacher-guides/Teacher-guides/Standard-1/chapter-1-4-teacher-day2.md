## Detailed Facilitation Notes

### Warm-up & Review (10 minutes)

- Welcome students and briefly recap Day 1 concepts
- Play the podcast review (5-7 minutes) covering the SMART framework, goal timeframes, and implementation strategies
- During the podcast, have students review their Day 1 SMART goals and make any initial refinements
- After the podcast, conduct a quick check for understanding with 2-3 review questions:
  - "What are the five components of a SMART goal?"
  - "How do short-term and long-term goals differ?"
  - "Why is it important to write down specific goals rather than just having them in mind?"

**Facilitation Tip**: While students are listening to the podcast, circulate to check their Day 1 SMART goals for completeness. Identify students who may need additional support during the station activities.

### Station 1: Goal Analysis & Timeline Builder (10 minutes)

#### Setup & Introduction
- Direct students to Station 1 in the digital environment
- Explain that they'll first rate the strength of each SMART component in their goals from Day 1
- Demonstrate the timeline builder tool using the example goal
- Show how to create milestones that break down the goal into manageable chunks

#### During the Activity
- Encourage students to identify at least 4-5 milestones for each goal
- Remind them to include specific dates and target amounts for savings goals
- Suggest they include specific actions at each milestone
- Help students who struggle with realistic milestone spacing

#### Monitoring Points
- Check that students are creating logical milestone progressions
- Ensure they're setting appropriate intermediate targets for financial goals
- Watch for unrealistic timelines that need adjustment
- Verify they're including specific actions at each milestone point

#### Key Questions to Pose:
- "What's a logical first milestone for your goal?"
- "How will you track progress between milestones?"
- "What specific actions need to happen at each stage?"
- "How did breaking your goal into milestones change your perspective on it?"

### Station 2: Obstacle Course Challenge (15 minutes)

#### Setup & Introduction
- Direct students to Station 2 in the digital environment
- Introduce the concept of obstacle analysis as a proactive approach to goal achievement
- Demonstrate how to categorize obstacles as internal (motivation, habits) or external (unexpected expenses, peer pressure)
- Show the obstacle-strategy pairing format

#### During the Activity
- Encourage students to identify at least 3 obstacles for each goal
- Suggest they rate the potential impact of each obstacle (high/medium/low)
- Guide them to develop specific, actionable strategies for each obstacle
- Remind students to create a resilience plan for handling multiple obstacles

#### Support Strategies
- For students struggling to identify obstacles, provide a list of common challenges:
  - Internal: Forgetting to save, impulse spending, losing motivation, competing priorities
  - External: Unexpected expenses, income changes, peer pressure, price increases
- For students struggling with strategies, use the "if-then" planning format:
  - "If [obstacle occurs], then I will [specific strategy]"

#### Monitoring Points
- Check that students are identifying both internal and external obstacles
- Ensure strategies are specific and actionable, not vague
- Verify that students create a realistic resilience plan
- Look for creative problem-solving approaches

### Station 3: Accountability System Designer (10 minutes)

#### Setup & Introduction
- Direct students to Station 3 in the digital environment
- Explain the importance of accountability for long-term goal achievement
- Demonstrate the components of an effective accountability system:
  - Tracking tools (apps, spreadsheets, journals)
  - Accountability partners
  - Regular review checkpoints
  - Milestone rewards

#### During the Activity
- Have students select tracking tools appropriate for their goals and preferences
- Guide them to identify at least one accountability partner
- Encourage them to establish a specific review schedule
- Help them design appropriate milestone celebrations that don't undermine their financial goals

#### Discussion Prompts
- "Who would make an effective accountability partner for your financial goals?"
- "What tracking method matches your personal style and habits?"
- "How often should you review progress for your specific goals?"
- "What types of rewards will motivate you without sabotaging your financial progress?"

**Guidance Note**: Emphasize that accountability systems should match students' personal preferences and habits. A complex system won't work if it doesn't fit their natural tendencies. Sometimes simpler is better.

### Portfolio Integration & Reflection (10 minutes)

#### Portfolio Completion
- Direct students to the Portfolio Integration section
- Explain that they are combining all elements from today's Learning Lab into a cohesive plan
- Have them review each section to ensure alignment across their entire plan
- Guide them to complete the portfolio summary reflecting on what they've learned

#### Sharing Insights
- Invite 3-4 volunteers to share one insight from their Financial Goals Portfolio
- Ask students to identify which component they think will be most helpful
- Have students share one strategy they learned from a peer today
- Discuss how these planning tools could be applied to non-financial goals

#### Closing Message
"Today you've transformed your SMART goals into a comprehensive action plan with timelines, strategies for overcoming obstacles, and personalized accountability systems. This Financial Goals Portfolio gives you everything you need to turn your financial aspirations into reality. Remember that achieving financial goals is rarely a straight lineâ€”expect adjustments along the way, but your planning today has significantly increased your chances of success."

## Differentiation Strategies

## Summative Assessment Guide

### Learning Lab Deliverable: Financial Goals Portfolio

#### Assessment Criteria
- Application of SMART criteria to refine original goals
- Development of specific, logical milestone timelines
- Identification of relevant obstacles with effective strategies
- Creation of personalized accountability systems
- Integration of all components into a coherent plan
- Reflection on the goal achievement process

#### Success Indicators
- **Excellent Work**: Portfolio shows comprehensive understanding of goal implementation through detailed timelines with specific actions, thoughtful obstacle analysis with creative solutions, customized accountability system matching personal preferences, seamless integration of all components, and insightful reflection on the planning process.

- **Proficient Work**: Portfolio demonstrates adequate understanding through logical timelines with basic milestones, identification of common obstacles with reasonable strategies, standard accountability system with basic tracking, general alignment between components, and straightforward reflection on the process.

- **Needs Improvement**: Portfolio shows limited understanding through incomplete timelines, minimal obstacle identification, basic or generic accountability approaches, limited connection between components, and superficial reflection.

**Recommendation**: Assessment should focus on the quality of implementation planning rather than the specific financial goals chosen. Students with modest financial goals but excellent implementation plans should be recognized for their strong planning skills.
