## Detailed Facilitation Notes

### Warm-up & Review (10 minutes)

- Begin by welcoming students and connecting today's Learning Lab to the budgeting concepts from Day 1
- Play the podcast (5 minutes) as a review of key income management concepts
- After the podcast, facilitate a brief discussion with questions like:
  - "What was one key takeaway from yesterday's lesson that you're still thinking about?"
  - "Did anyone try tracking their expenses or categorizing them since our last class?"
  - "What questions do you still have about the 50/30/20 rule?"
- Explain the Learning Lab structure: four stations that will help apply the theoretical concepts from Day 1

**Facilitation Tip**: If time is limited, you can have students listen to the podcast as pre-work before class to maximize hands-on time in the stations.

### Activity 1: Income Management Simulator (10 minutes)

#### Setup & Introduction
- Briefly demonstrate the simulator on the projector, showing how adjusting the sliders affects the long-term financial outcomes
- Point out the scenario selection dropdown and how students can choose a scenario that most closely matches their situation
- Explain that the long-term impact chart visualizes how today's budget decisions compound over time
- Emphasize that there's no single "correct" allocation—different financial situations require different approaches

#### During the Activity
- Encourage students to test multiple budget allocations and observe the differences in outcomes
- Prompt students to notice how adjusting the savings allocation affects both emergency fund growth and debt reduction
- Suggest students try the different scenarios to see how variable income or debt affects optimal budget allocations
- Challenge advanced students to find the allocation that produces the best five-year outcomes

#### Monitoring Points:
- Check that students understand how to interpret the simulation chart
- Ensure students are testing multiple allocations rather than just setting one and moving on
- Listen for insights about the relationship between saving rates and long-term financial health
- Be prepared to explain why debt reduction happens before significant investment growth in the simulation

#### Key Questions to Pose:
- "What happens when you increase the savings allocation above 20%?"
- "How does having debt at the beginning change your optimal allocation strategy?"
- "What trade-offs did you make when adjusting between needs, wants, and savings?"
- "Which allocation gave you the best long-term results, and why do you think that is?"

### Activity 2: Budget Challenge Workshop (15 minutes)

#### Setup & Introduction
- Explain that financial challenges often require adjusting our budgets quickly
- Review the four challenge scenarios: emergency car repair, income reduction, unexpected opportunity, and debt vs. savings prioritization
- Clarify that the goal is to develop specific, actionable strategies for each challenge while maintaining financial stability
- Remind students that there are multiple valid approaches to each scenario

#### During the Activity
- If possible, have students work in pairs or small groups to discuss strategies
- Encourage students to be specific in their solutions (e.g., "Reduce dining out by $150" rather than "Spend less")
- Suggest students consider both immediate fixes and longer-term preventative strategies
- Remind students to apply the 50/30/20 principle even when making adjustments

#### Support Strategies
- For students who struggle to start, suggest focusing on the wants category first for potential reductions
- Provide a structured problem-solving framework: identify the issue, list options, evaluate pros/cons, choose a solution
- If students finish early, ask them to create their own financial challenge scenario
- Have example solutions ready to help guide students who are stuck

#### Monitoring Points:
- Check that students are addressing both the immediate issue and considering longer-term implications
- Look for realistic, specific strategies rather than vague generalizations
- Listen for creative solutions that maintain financial well-being while addressing the challenge
- Note any common misconceptions to address during group discussion

### Activity 3: Financial Goals Action Plan & Peer Review (15 minutes)

#### Setup & Introduction
- Explain that effective income management requires aligning your budget with specific financial goals
- Review the components of the Financial Goals Action Plan: short-term goals, long-term goals, budget adjustments, and obstacle planning
- Demonstrate how to complete the first section using a simple example
- Explain the peer review component: students will analyze a sample budget and provide constructive feedback

#### During the Activity
- First 10 minutes: Students complete their personal Financial Goals Action Plan
  - Encourage specific, measurable goals with clear timelines
  - Remind students to align their budget allocations with their stated goals
  - Suggest they reference their Day 1 budget when making plan adjustments
- Last 5 minutes: Students review the sample budget and provide feedback
  - Point out the misalignment between the sample budget allocations and stated goals
  - Encourage constructive, specific recommendations

#### Discussion Prompts:
- "How does having specific financial goals change your approach to budgeting?"
- "What did you notice about Jordan's budget that could be improved?"
- "How might your budget priorities change as your life circumstances change?"
- "What was the most valuable insight you gained from reviewing someone else's budget?"

**Guidance Note**: The peer review is intentionally structured to analyze a sample budget rather than peer-to-peer review to ensure privacy and comfort around financial discussions.

### Reflection & Wrap-up (5 minutes)

#### Portfolio Completion
- Guide students to complete the Portfolio Integration section, combining elements from all four stations
- Emphasize the connections between the different components:
  - How the simulation results inform goal setting
  - How challenge solutions support realistic planning
  - How peer review insights can improve their personal budget
- Remind students that their portfolio should be a practical document they can reference and adapt over time

#### Sharing Insights
- If time permits, invite 2-3 volunteers to share one key insight from today's Learning Lab
- Ask students to complete the final reflection prompt about implementing these strategies in their own lives
- Point out that the strategies learned today apply regardless of income level
- Emphasize that effective income management is a skill that develops with practice and adjustment

#### Closing Message:
Remind students that income management isn't about restricting their spending but rather about intentionally directing their resources toward what matters most to them. The tools and strategies they've practiced today provide a foundation for making informed financial decisions throughout their lives, regardless of their income level or life stage.
