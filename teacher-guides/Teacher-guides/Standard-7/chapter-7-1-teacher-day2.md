## Detailed Facilitation Notes

### Warm-up & Review (5 minutes)

- Have students put on headphones and listen to the podcast review of Day 1 concepts:
  - Principal, interest, APR
  - Secured vs. unsecured credit
  - Installment vs. non-installment credit
  - Factors affecting loan costs
- After the podcast, quickly check for understanding with 2-3 targeted questions:
  - "What's the difference between secured and unsecured credit?"
  - "Why do interest rates matter when borrowing money?"
- Connect today's learning lab activities directly to yesterday's concepts:
  - "Today we'll apply these concepts to see how they affect real borrowing decisions"

**Facilitation Tip**: Use this warm-up to identify any students who may need additional support with fundamental concepts before moving to application activities.

### Activity 1: Loan Calculator (15 minutes)

#### Setup & Introduction
- Direct students to the Loan Calculator station on the learning platform
- Take 2 minutes to demonstrate the basic functionality:
  - Slider for principal amount
  - Slider for interest rate
  - Dropdown for loan term
  - Dropdown for payment frequency
- Show how outputs update in real-time as inputs change
- Point out the amortization schedule and graph features

#### During the Activity
- Have students first calculate a baseline scenario:
  - $20,000 car loan at 5.9% for 5 years with monthly payments
  - Have them record the monthly payment and total interest paid
- Guide students through systematic variable changes:
  - Change term to 3 years (observe higher payment but lower total interest)
  - Change term to 7 years (observe lower payment but higher total interest)
  - Increase interest rate by 2% (observe impact on payment and total cost)
  - Change payment frequency to bi-weekly (observe impact on loan duration and interest)
- Ask students to find a loan configuration that results in the lowest total interest while keeping monthly payments below $400

#### Key Questions to Pose:
- "What happens to the monthly payment when you extend the loan term? What happens to the total interest paid?"
- "Which has a bigger impact on total cost: changing the interest rate or changing the loan term?"
- "How much could you save by making bi-weekly payments instead of monthly payments?"
- "What is the relationship between the monthly payment amount and the total interest paid over the life of the loan?"

### Activity 2: Borrowing Decision Simulator (15 minutes)

#### Setup & Introduction
- Direct students to the Borrowing Decision Simulator
- Explain that they will work through realistic scenarios where they need to make borrowing decisions
- Each scenario presents a financial situation, available options, and requires a decision
- Students should evaluate options based on:
  - Financial impact (total cost)
  - Alignment with personal goals
  - Risk assessment
  - Affordability of payments
- Review the first scenario together as a class to model the decision-making process

#### During the Activity
- Have students work through at least 3 scenarios independently
- For each scenario, students should:
  - Review the financial situation carefully
  - Analyze all available options (not just the borrowing options)
  - Calculate the total cost for each option
  - Make a decision
  - Provide written justification for their choice
- Circulate to provide guidance and prompt deeper thinking

#### Support Strategies
- For students who are rushing through without analysis, ask probing questions:
  - "What is the total cost of this option over time?"
  - "How does this payment fit into the monthly budget in this scenario?"
  - "What are the risks if the person's financial situation changes?"
- Pair struggling students with those who demonstrate strong analytical skills
- Provide calculation assistance for students having difficulty with the numbers

#### Monitoring Points:
- Watch for students focusing only on monthly payments without considering total cost
- Identify students who are making decisions without thorough analysis
- Note particularly insightful justifications to share during discussion
- Look for creative approaches that consider alternatives to borrowing

### Activity 3: Real-Cost Analysis & Portfolio Development (15 minutes)

#### Setup & Introduction
- Direct students to the Real-Cost Analysis Tool
- Explain that different payment strategies can dramatically affect the total cost of a loan
- Review the base loan example that will be used for comparison:
  - $25,000 loan at 6% interest for 10 years
- Introduce the payment strategies they'll analyze:
  - Standard payment (minimum required)
  - Extra monthly payments (+$100/month)
  - Bi-weekly payments (half of monthly payment every two weeks)
  - Annual lump sum payment ($1,000 at the end of each year)

#### During the Activity
- Guide students through comparing the different strategies:
  - Have them record the total interest paid for each strategy
  - Note the time saved on loan repayment
  - Calculate the total savings compared to the standard payment
- Direct students to begin developing their Borrowing Strategy Portfolio:
  - Create a personalized borrowing philosophy statement
  - List specific criteria they'll use when evaluating borrowing decisions
  - Develop a prioritized list of strategies to minimize borrowing costs
  - Design a basic debt management plan framework

#### Discussion Prompts:
- "Which payment strategy provides the most significant savings? Is it also the most practical?"
- "How would you adjust your strategy based on different loan types (mortgage vs. car loan)?"
- "What factors beyond interest rate and term would influence your borrowing decisions?"
- "What guidelines would you set for yourself to ensure responsible borrowing in the future?"

**Guidance Note**: Emphasize that there is no one-size-fits-all approach to borrowing. The portfolio should reflect their personal values, financial goals, and risk tolerance.

### Reflection & Wrap-up (5 minutes)

#### Portfolio Completion
- Give students 2-3 minutes to finalize their Borrowing Strategy Portfolio
- Encourage them to include at least:
  - 3-5 specific criteria for evaluating borrowing options
  - 2-3 strategies to minimize borrowing costs
  - 1-2 personal guidelines regarding when borrowing is appropriate
  - A brief statement about their approach to debt

#### Sharing Insights
- Ask 2-3 volunteers to share one surprising insight from today's activities
- Prompt students to reflect on how the Learning Lab changed their thinking:
  - "Has today's learning lab changed how you think about borrowing? In what way?"
  - "What's one specific strategy you'll use in the future when considering a loan?"
- Acknowledge thoughtful responses and interesting approaches

#### Closing Message:
Understanding the true cost of borrowing empowers you to make informed financial decisions throughout your life. Whether you're considering education loans, a car purchase, or a mortgage in the future, the analytical skills you've practiced today will help you minimize costs and borrow strategically. Remember that borrowing isn't inherently good or bad—it's a tool that can either help or hurt your financial wellbeing depending on how you use it.
