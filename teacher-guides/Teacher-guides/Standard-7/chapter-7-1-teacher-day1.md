## Section-by-Section Teaching Notes

### Learning Objectives

#### Teaching Notes
The learning objectives set the foundation for understanding borrowing concepts that students will encounter throughout their financial lives. Begin by highlighting why understanding borrowing is a critical life skill, regardless of whether students plan to take loans in the near future. Emphasize that knowledge of these concepts helps avoid costly mistakes.

#### Facilitation Tips
- Ask students to share what they already know about borrowing to gauge prior knowledge
- Connect objectives to real-life situations students might encounter after high school
- Use simple analogies to introduce the concept of interest (e.g., "borrowing costs money, like renting costs money")

#### Objective Unpacking
- **Define key borrowing terms**: Key points: Students should understand principal, interest rate, APR, and collateral as fundamental vocabulary for any borrowing discussion
- **Distinguish secured and unsecured credit**: Key points: Help students understand that the presence of collateral significantly affects interest rates and borrower risk
- **Compare installment and non-installment credit**: Key points: Focus on payment structure differences and how they affect budgeting and total cost
- **Calculate loan costs**: Key points: Emphasize that seemingly small interest rate differences can lead to thousands of dollars in additional costs
- **Evaluate when borrowing is appropriate**: Key points: Discuss the difference between borrowing for assets/investments versus consumables
- **Develop cost minimization strategies**: Key points: Introduce the concept that borrowers have agency in how they manage their loans

### Introduction

#### Teaching Notes
Use the introduction to establish both the utility and risks of borrowing. Many students may have observed negative experiences with debt in their families or communities, so acknowledge these while also presenting responsible borrowing as a potential tool. Emphasize that borrowing isn't inherently good or bad—it depends on the purpose, terms, and borrower's financial situation.

#### Facilitation Tips
- Begin with an engaging opening question: "Has anyone in your family ever taken out a loan? What was it for?"
- List common borrowing purposes on the board as students share (education, homes, cars, emergencies)
- Emphasize the "tool, not solution" concept of borrowing

#### Potential Misconceptions
- "All debt is bad" - Clarify that strategic borrowing can help build wealth (e.g., education, home ownership)
- "If I can get approved, I can afford it" - Explain that lenders' approval doesn't necessarily mean a loan is affordable
- "Interest rates don't matter much" - Demonstrate how even small rate differences significantly impact total cost

#### Discussion Starters
- "What are some things people typically borrow money to purchase?"
- "Why might someone choose to borrow money instead of waiting to save up?"
- "When might borrowing money be a good financial decision? When might it be problematic?"

### Key Concepts

#### Teaching Notes
This section forms the critical vocabulary foundation for students. Take time to thoroughly explain each term, providing simple examples for each. The terms are interconnected, so showing these relationships helps students develop a comprehensive understanding. Present terms in logical groupings rather than alphabetically.

#### Facilitation Tips
- Write each term on the board with a simple definition
- Use color-coding to show related concepts (e.g., principal and interest in different colors)
- Have students create their own definitions in pairs before sharing the formal definitions

#### Concept Deep Dives
- **Principal**
  - Elaboration: Use an analogy of borrowing $20 from a friend—the principal is that original $20
  - Common confusion: Students sometimes conflate principal with the total loan amount including interest

- **Interest Rate & APR**
  - Elaboration: Explain that interest is the "rental fee" for money, and APR includes both interest and fees
  - Common confusion: Students often don't recognize the significant difference between interest rate and APR

- **Secured vs. Unsecured Credit**
  - Elaboration: Use the analogy of lending a book to a friend without collateral versus lending with their video game as collateral
  - Common confusion: Students sometimes think "secured" means safer for the borrower, when it actually describes lender security

- **Collateral**
  - Elaboration: Explain using specific examples like a car for an auto loan or a house for a mortgage
  - Common confusion: Students may not realize that collateral can be repossessed even after making many payments

- **Default**
  - Elaboration: Clarify the severity of defaulting and its long-term impact on credit
  - Common confusion: Students may think missing one payment equals default

#### Comprehension Check Questions
- "If you take out a $5,000 loan, what is the principal amount?"
- "Why would a lender charge a higher interest rate for an unsecured loan compared to a secured loan?"
- "How does collateral protect the lender in a loan agreement?"

### Types of Credit

#### Teaching Notes
This section introduces the two main classification systems for credit: secured/unsecured and installment/non-installment. Help students understand that these categories often overlap—a loan can be both secured and installment (like a mortgage), or unsecured and non-installment (like a credit card). Use a visual matrix to show these relationships.

#### Facilitation Tips
- Create a 2x2 grid on the board showing the four possible combinations of secured/unsecured and installment/non-installment
- Place common loan types in their appropriate quadrants
- Ask students to analyze which quadrant typically has the highest and lowest interest rates, and why

#### Discussion Questions
- "Why might someone choose a secured loan over an unsecured loan if they have the option?"
- "What are the advantages and disadvantages of installment credit compared to non-installment credit?"
- "Why do you think credit cards (unsecured, non-installment credit) typically have higher interest rates than mortgages (secured, installment credit)?"

#### Teaching Challenges & Solutions
- **Challenge**: Students confuse the classifications and their implications
  - **Solution**: Create a visual chart comparing loan types with their classifications and typical interest rates
- **Challenge**: Students may not see how these classifications affect real-world loan costs
  - **Solution**: Provide concrete examples showing cost differences between different loan types

#### Subsection: Secured vs. Unsecured Credit
- Emphasize that security refers to the lender's protection, not the borrower's
- Explain that the presence of collateral significantly reduces lender risk, thus lowering interest rates
- Use examples relevant to students' lives: auto loans (secured) vs. student loans (unsecured)

#### Subsection: Installment vs. Non-Installment Credit
- Highlight predictability as the key benefit of installment loans
- Explain that non-installment credit's flexibility often comes with higher costs if not managed carefully
- Discuss how revolving credit (like credit cards) can lead to long-term debt if only minimum payments are made

### Understanding Interest and Fees

#### Teaching Notes
This section demonstrates the dramatic difference that interest rates, terms, and payment strategies can make to the total cost of borrowing. Use the student loan and credit card examples to illustrate how seemingly small decisions can have enormous financial implications. The visual impact of seeing the total costs is particularly powerful.

#### Facilitation Tips
- Walk through calculations step-by-step on the board
- Have students calculate the difference between total costs for the two examples ($25,432 - $12,437 = $12,995)
- Ask students to express this difference in relatable terms ("That's enough to buy a decent used car!")

#### Example Analysis
- **Student Loan Example**
  - Key points to emphasize: The power of lower interest rates, the benefit of structured repayment
  - Discussion questions: "How much extra are you paying beyond the principal? What percentage is that of the original loan?"

- **Credit Card Example**
  - Key points to emphasize: The danger of minimum payments, the shocking timeline (28 years!)
  - Discussion questions: "Why would it take so long to pay off this debt? What is the ratio of interest to principal in this example?"

#### Extension Activity
Have students calculate how much could be saved by paying $200 per month on the credit card debt instead of the minimum payment. This demonstrates the power of paying more than the minimum.

### Real-World Examples

#### Teaching Notes
The real-world examples put borrowing decisions in context, showing how people evaluate options based on multiple factors. These scenarios help students move from abstract concepts to practical application. Use these examples to show the decision-making process, not just the final decision.

#### Facilitation Tips
- Have students work in pairs to analyze each scenario before discussing as a class
- Ask students to identify the key decision factors in each scenario
- Encourage students to respectfully debate whether they agree with Julia's and Ravi's decisions

#### Example Analysis
- **Julia's Student Loan Decision**
  - Key points to emphasize: Lower interest rate, flexible repayment options, long-term financial impact
  - Discussion questions: "What other factors might Julia consider beyond interest rate? How might her choice of major or career plans affect this decision?"

- **Ravi's Car Purchase**
  - Key points to emphasize: Total cost comparison, avoidance of interest, lower ongoing costs
  - Discussion questions: "What situations might make Ravi's decision different? When might financing be the better option despite the added cost?"

#### Extension Activity
Ask students to create their own borrowing scenario with two options and analyze which would be more financially sound.

### Skill Builder Activity

#### Activity Overview
The Loan Comparison Chart is the cornerstone of Day 1 content and connects directly to Day 2 learning activities. This hands-on application helps students translate knowledge into practical evaluation skills for comparing loan options.

**Key Connection**: This Skill Builder specifically connects to the Day 2 Learning Lab by providing foundational knowledge about loan types that students will use in the interactive loan calculator and borrowing decision simulator activities. The familiarity with loan characteristics gained here will be directly applied during the Learning Lab.

#### Activity Objectives
- Identify characteristics of different loan types
- Compare interest rates and terms across loan options
- Evaluate appropriate uses for different types of credit
- Recognize high-risk borrowing options like payday loans

#### Step-by-Step Facilitation
1. **Introduction (2 min)**: Introduce the Loan Comparison Chart as a reference tool for evaluating borrowing options
2. **Instructions & Examples (3 min)**: Explain the chart's organization and key features to analyze
3. **Independent Work (5 min)**: Have students study the chart and take notes on what stands out to them
4. **Progress Check (1 min)**: Ask a few students to share one interesting observation from the chart
5. **Reflection Questions (4 min)**: Direct students to answer the two reflection questions
6. **Sharing & Discussion (3 min)**: Have several students share their responses
7. **Connection to Day 2 (2 min)**: Explain how this information will be used in tomorrow's Learning Lab

#### Common Challenges & Solutions
- **Challenge**: Students focus only on interest rates, ignoring other loan features
  - **Solution**: Point out how fees, terms, and flexibility can be equally important
- **Challenge**: Students may not understand why anyone would use high-cost options like payday loans
  - **Solution**: Discuss situations where people might feel they have no alternatives
- **Challenge**: Abstract comparison without context
  - **Solution**: Ask students to imagine specific scenarios where they might use each loan type
- **Challenge**: Information overload from the comprehensive chart
  - **Solution**: Direct students to focus on 3-4 loan types most relevant to young adults first

#### Differentiation Strategies
- **For Students Who Need Support**:
  - Provide a simplified version of the chart focusing on fewer loan types
  - Offer guiding questions to help structure their analysis
  - Work with these students in a small group to discuss each loan type
  - Create a matching exercise connecting loan types to appropriate purposes

- **For Advanced Students**:
  - Challenge them to calculate the total cost for a specific scenario with each loan type
  - Ask them to research and add current market interest rates to the chart
  - Have them create a decision tree for choosing between loan types
  - Encourage analysis of how credit scores affect loan terms and availability

#### Examples & Models
- **Basic Example**: A completed reflection noting that payday loans would be most challenging to manage due to high interest rates, and that the student would choose an auto loan for a car purchase because it has a reasonable interest rate and fixed payments.
- **Exemplary Example**: A thorough analysis that compares long-term costs of different loan options, discusses the relationship between security and interest rates, evaluates the risk-reward tradeoff of different options, and creates a personal decision framework for when different loan types would be appropriate.

#### Connection to Day 2
The Skill Builder activity is directly connected to the Day 2 Learning Lab and serves as essential preparation. Make these connections explicit to students:
- Day 2, Station 1 (Loan Calculator) will use the loan types you've learned about today
- Day 2, Station 2 (Borrowing Decision Simulator) will require you to evaluate options similar to those in the chart
- The knowledge of different loan characteristics will be essential for creating your Borrowing Strategy Portfolio

**Important**: Ensure students understand the key differences between loan types, as they will need this knowledge to make informed decisions in tomorrow's activities.

#### Assessment Guidance
When reviewing student work on the Skill Builder activity, look for:
- Evidence that students can identify key differences between loan types
- Thoughtful evaluation of which loans are appropriate for different purposes
- Recognition of high-cost borrowing options and their risks
- Personalized analysis reflecting individual priorities and values
- Preparation for Day 2 learning extensions

**Assessment Note**: This Skill Builder is a formative assessment opportunity. Provide feedback that will help students improve for Day 2 rather than focusing on grading.

**Feedback Approach**: When providing feedback, focus on one strength ("I notice you did a good job identifying appropriate uses for different loan types") and one area for growth ("For Day 2, consider how interest rates affect the total cost over different time periods").

### Reflection Prompt

#### Teaching Notes
The reflection prompt asks students to apply their learning by evaluating when borrowing is and isn't appropriate. This helps them move beyond rules like "all debt is bad" to a more nuanced understanding of strategic borrowing. The prompt directly supports one of the key learning objectives: evaluating when borrowing is appropriate versus when it should be avoided.

#### Facilitation Tips
- Provide a clear timer (3 minutes) for this reflection
- Remind students this is personal reflection, not a graded assessment
- Encourage authentic, thoughtful responses rather than what students think you want to hear

#### Additional Reflection Prompts
- "How might your approach to borrowing differ from that of your parents or grandparents?"
- "What factors besides interest rate should you consider when deciding whether to borrow?"
- "How might your attitude toward borrowing change for different purposes (education, car, vacation)?"

#### Reflection-to-Skill Builder Connection
Make sure students understand how their reflections should inform their approach to the Loan Comparison Chart activity. This transition is crucial for helping students connect personal values to practical application. The reflection helps students identify their borrowing principles, which they'll need when analyzing different loan types.

## Conclusion and Next Steps

As you conclude the lesson, emphasize to students the importance of understanding the fundamental concepts covered today. These will serve as the foundation for tomorrow's more interactive and application-focused learning lab.

### Ensuring Work is Saved
- Remind students that their reflection responses and Skill Builder work will be referenced in Day 2
- Ask students to make note of which loan types they found most relevant to their future plans
- Suggest students note any questions that arose during today's lesson to explore further tomorrow
- Preview how they'll use today's conceptual understanding for practical application in the Learning Lab

### Preview for Day 2
Let students know that in the Day 2 Learning Lab, they will:
- Use an interactive loan calculator to see the real impact of different variables
- Work through realistic borrowing scenarios using a decision simulator
- Compare different payment strategies and their effect on total cost
- Develop a personal borrowing strategy framework to guide future decisions

## Discussion Prompts

### For Introduction:
"What are some reasons people borrow money, and which of these reasons do you think make the most financial sense?"
**Expected responses**: Education (investment in future earnings), home purchase (builds equity), emergencies (necessary expense), cars (for transportation to work), starting a business (potential return on investment)

### For Types of Credit:
"Why do you think secured loans typically have lower interest rates than unsecured loans?"
**Expected responses**: Less risk for the lender because they can take the collateral; lender has a guaranteed way to recover money; borrower has more incentive to pay to avoid losing the collateral

### For Understanding Interest:
"Why do you think making only minimum payments on credit cards can be financially dangerous?"
**Expected responses**: Takes much longer to pay off the balance; dramatically increases the total amount paid; keeps you in debt for years; most of each payment goes to interest rather than principal

## Differentiation Strategies

### For Advanced Students
- Have them calculate amortization schedules for simple loans
- Assign research on how credit scores affect loan terms and rates
- Challenge them to create cost comparison charts for different loan scenarios
- Ask them to analyze how inflation affects the real cost of long-term loans
- Encourage them to research historical trends in interest rates

### For Struggling Students
- Provide simplified definitions with visual aids for key terms
- Focus on the basic concept that borrowing costs money beyond repaying the principal
- Use concrete, relevant examples like car loans or student loans
- Offer step-by-step calculation guides for determining loan costs
- Create a matching activity for loan types and their characteristics

### For ELL Students
- Provide a glossary of key terms with simple definitions
- Use visual representations of concepts wherever possible
- Allow partner work for discussion activities
- Provide sentence frames for reflection responses
- Connect concepts to universal experiences that transcend cultural differences
- Allow extra time for processing complex financial terms

## Assessment Opportunities

### Formative Assessment
- Monitor participation during discussion of borrowing concepts
- Check understanding through questioning during explanation of loan types
- Review responses to "which loan is most challenging to manage" reflection question
- Observe student analysis of the Loan Comparison Chart
- Listen for misconceptions during pair/share activities
- Pay attention to questions students ask, which can reveal areas of confusion

### Summative Assessment
- Evaluate reflection responses for depth of understanding
- Assess skill builder activity completion and quality of analysis
- Consider a brief exit ticket asking students to identify one key learning
- Review student justifications for loan type selections
- Evaluate students' ability to connect concepts to real-world decisions
- Assess completion of the borrowing scenarios analysis

## Summative Assessment Guide

### Deliverable: Borrowing Decision Analysis

#### Assessment Criteria
- Thoroughness of concept understanding and application
- Quality and appropriateness of loan type analysis
- Completeness of cost comparison calculations
- Integration of multiple factors in decision-making process
- Evidence of critical thinking about appropriate borrowing

#### Success Indicators
- **Excellent Work**: Demonstrates thorough understanding of different loan types and their characteristics, comprehensive cost analysis including interest and fees, detailed examination of appropriate uses for each loan type, and thoughtful reflection on personal borrowing principles.
- **Proficient Work**: Shows adequate understanding of major loan types, basic cost analysis focused primarily on interest rates, general understanding of appropriate uses, and some personal reflection on borrowing decisions.
- **Needs Improvement**: Exhibits minimal understanding of loan types, incomplete or inaccurate cost analysis, limited recognition of appropriate loan uses, and superficial personal reflection lacking substantive connections to course concepts.

**Note**: Focus feedback on students' understanding of the relationship between loan characteristics and total cost, as well as their ability to match appropriate loan types to specific purposes.
