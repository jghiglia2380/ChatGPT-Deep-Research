## Detailed Facilitation Notes

### Warm-up & Review (10 minutes)

- Direct students to listen to the podcast review of consumer credit laws covered in Day 1
- While students are listening, display a visual reminder of the six major laws
- After the podcast, conduct a quick verbal review with the following questions:
  - "Name one law that protects consumers when borrowing money"
  - "What is one key protection provided by the (law named by student)?"
  - "When might you personally benefit from this protection?"
- Clarify any misconceptions that emerge during the review
- Remind students that today's activities will apply this knowledge to real-world situations

**Facilitation Tip**: If technology issues arise with the podcast, be prepared to lead a brief verbal review of the key laws and protections as an alternative.

### Activity 1: Case Study Analysis (15 minutes)

#### Setup & Introduction
- Direct students to the digital case studies
- Explain that they will analyze 3-4 realistic scenarios involving potential consumer credit law violations
- Review the analysis framework: identifying applicable laws, consumer rights, and recommended actions
- Emphasize that for each scenario, they should be specific about which aspects of the law apply
- Encourage students to reference the Consumer Credit Laws Table from Day 1

#### During the Activity
- Circulate to provide guidance and check for understanding
- Listen for misconceptions that might need whole-class clarification
- Prompt students with guiding questions if they're struggling:
  - "What type of financial activity is happening in this scenario?"
  - "Which laws cover this type of activity?"
  - "What specific rights do those laws provide?"
  - "What actions should the consumer take first?"

#### Group Sharing
- After 10 minutes of individual work, call on students to share their analyses
- For each case, ask one student to identify the applicable law, another to describe the consumer rights, and a third to suggest appropriate actions
- Confirm correct responses and gently correct misunderstandings
- Highlight that different laws may overlap in some scenarios

#### Key Questions to Pose:
- "How might the outcome be different if the consumer doesn't know their rights?"
- "Why might it be challenging to recognize when your consumer rights have been violated?"
- "What are the first steps you should always take when you suspect a violation?"
- "How might companies try to discourage consumers from asserting their rights?"

### Activity 2: Consumer Rights Research (15 minutes)

#### Setup & Introduction
- Direct students to the digital research worksheet
- Explain that knowing your rights is only useful if you also know how to enforce them
- Review the research worksheet sections:
  - Filing complaints with regulatory agencies
  - Resources for consumers whose rights have been violated
  - Recent updates or changes to consumer credit laws
- Provide starting points for research, including the CFPB website, FTC website, and other trusted sources
- Clarify that students may focus on 1-2 laws that interest them most for their research

#### During the Activity
- Encourage students to be specific in documenting complaint procedures
- Remind them to record direct URLs to resources they find helpful
- Suggest they look for both government and non-profit resources
- Prompt them to evaluate the credibility of each resource they find

#### Support Strategies
- For students who need direction, suggest focusing on the CFPB complaint process first
- Have a list of recommended websites ready for students who struggle with search terms
- Consider allowing students to work in pairs if some are struggling with the research process
- Provide a scaffolded worksheet with specific prompts for students who need more structure

#### Monitoring Points:
- Check that students are finding actionable information, not just general descriptions
- Ensure students are recording specific procedures and contact information
- Watch for students who may be getting overwhelmed by too much information
- Note particularly useful resources identified by students to share with the whole class

### Activity 3: "Know Your Rights" Guide Creation (10 minutes)

#### Setup & Introduction
- Direct students to the "Know Your Rights" guide template
- Explain that they're creating a practical reference that will become part of their financial portfolio
- Review the required sections:
  - Key protections summary for each major law
  - Steps to take if rights are violated
  - Contact information for relevant agencies
- Emphasize that this should be personalized to include the protections they find most relevant to their lives
- Demonstrate a sample completed guide that shows appropriate level of detail

#### During the Activity
- Encourage students to incorporate both Day 1 knowledge and Day 2 research
- Remind them to use clear, concise language they would understand in a stressful situation
- Suggest they prioritize information by likelihood of relevance to their lives
- Emphasize the importance of including specific actionable steps

#### Discussion Prompts:
- "Which of these protections do you think will be most relevant to you in the next few years?"
- "What information would be most important to have readily available if you suspected a violation?"
- "How might you use this guide to help friends or family members who face consumer credit issues?"
- "What format would make this information most accessible to you in a real situation?"

**Guidance Note**: Some students may want to add creative elements or personal touches to their guides. Encourage this personalization as it can enhance retention and relevance, as long as the core information remains clear and accurate.

### Reflection & Wrap-up (5 minutes)

#### Portfolio Completion
- Direct students to save their completed "Know Your Rights" guide to their portfolio
- Emphasize that this should be a living document they update as they learn more
- Encourage them to share this resource with family members
- Explain how this knowledge connects to other financial topics covered in the course

#### Sharing Insights
- Ask 2-3 volunteers to share one key insight from today's activities
- Invite students to share which consumer protection they found most surprising or important
- Ask for examples of how they might use this knowledge in the near future
- Acknowledge thoughtful applications and personal connections to the material

#### Closing Message:
Consumer credit laws provide essential protections, but they only work when you know your rights and how to assert them. The knowledge and resources you've developed today aren't just for a gradeâ€”they're practical tools that can save you money, protect your credit, and ensure fair treatment throughout your financial life. Keep your "Know Your Rights" guide accessible and don't hesitate to refer to it whenever you engage with credit products.

## Differentiation Strategies

### For Advanced Students
- Challenge them to research a recent court case involving consumer credit law violations
- Ask them to compare the U.S. consumer protection framework with that of another country
- Suggest they analyze a real credit agreement for compliance with disclosure requirements
- Encourage them to create an informational resource they could share with the community
- Invite them to investigate emerging issues in consumer protection like fintech regulations

### For Struggling Students
- Provide a simplified template with more structure for the "Know Your Rights" guide
- Offer pre-selected research resources rather than having them search independently
- Allow them to focus on fewer laws (2-3) rather than all six
- Provide additional scaffolding questions for the case study analysis
- Consider allowing collaboration with a peer for research activities
- Offer visual organizers to help structure their thinking

### For ELL Students
- Provide glossary of key terms used in the case studies
- Allow use of translation tools for research activities
- Offer sentence frames for reflection responses
- Provide visual cues and icons for different types of consumer protections
- Consider pairing with a language buddy for collaborative work
- Allow recording of verbal responses instead of written answers if preferred
