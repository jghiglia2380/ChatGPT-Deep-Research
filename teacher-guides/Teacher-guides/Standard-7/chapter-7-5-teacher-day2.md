  - "How does the choice of repayment plan affect the total amount repaid?"
  - "What factors should influence how much you borrow for education?"
- Remind students to access their College Budget Worksheet from Day 1, as it will inform their work in today's Learning Lab
- Explain the station-based approach for today's Learning Lab and how each station builds toward a comprehensive student loan strategy

**Facilitation Tip**: Some students may be anxious about the prospect of student loans. Acknowledge these concerns while emphasizing that the goal of today's Learning Lab is to help them make informed decisions that align with their educational and career goals.

### Station 1: Student Loan Repayment Simulator (10 minutes)

  - Different repayment periods to see the effect on monthly payments and total interest
  - Impact of income on debt-to-income ratio
- Remind students to save their observations in the insights section
- Prompt students to save their most realistic scenario for comparison

#### Group Sharing
- After about 8 minutes, ask 2-3 students to share one surprising insight they gained
- Highlight comments that demonstrate understanding of how different variables affect repayment
- Reinforce the concept that small differences in interest rates or loan terms can have significant long-term impacts

#### Key Questions to Pose:
- "How does extending the repayment period affect monthly payments versus total interest paid?"
- "What interest rate difference did you notice between federal and private loan scenarios?"
- "Which variable had the biggest impact on your total repayment amount?"
- "Based on your simulations, what's a reasonable monthly student loan payment for someone with a $40,000 annual salary?"

### Station 2: Career Earnings Research (10 minutes)
