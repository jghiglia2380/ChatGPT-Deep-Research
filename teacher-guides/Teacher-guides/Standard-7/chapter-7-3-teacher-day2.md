## Detailed Facilitation Notes

### Warm-up & Review (5 minutes)

- Begin by reminding students of yesterday's key concepts: the five FICO score components and their relative weights
- Play the podcast review (approximately 2-3 minutes) to reinforce essential credit score concepts
- Explain the Learning Lab structure: "Today you'll move through three stations that build on each other"
- Clarify that each station incorporates concepts from Day 1 into practical applications
- Orient students to the digital platform navigation and station progress indicators

**Facilitation Tip**: While students listen to the podcast, display a visual reminder of the five credit score components to reinforce these key elements.

### Activity 1: Credit Score Simulator (15 minutes)

#### Setup & Introduction
- Direct students to the Credit Score Simulator station in the digital platform
- Explain that the simulator compresses time to show effects that would take months/years in real life
- Show students the starting credit score (typically 670, in the "good" range)
- Demonstrate how to make decisions when prompted and observe score changes
- Emphasize that students should try multiple scenarios to see different outcomes

#### During the Activity
- Circulate to ensure students understand the connection between their choices and score changes
- Encourage students to experiment with both positive and negative decisions
- Prompt deeper thinking: "Which behaviors seem to have the biggest positive impact? The biggest negative impact?"
- Challenge students to see if they can raise the simulated score to "excellent" (above 800)
- Remind students to note which specific FICO components are affected by each decision

#### Group Sharing
- After about 12 minutes of simulation time, call for attention
- Ask 2-3 volunteers to share one surprising insight from the simulator
- Create a quick class list of "Most Impactful Behaviors" based on student observations
- Connect observations back to the FICO component weights from Day 1

#### Key Questions to Pose:
- "How did your simulation results align with what you expected based on yesterday's learning?"
- "Which behaviors had the most significant positive impact on the credit score?"
- "Which behaviors caused the most severe negative consequences?"
- "How does the simulator help you understand the time factor in credit building?"

### Activity 2: Credit Score Impact Calculator (15 minutes)

#### Setup & Introduction
- Guide students to the Credit Score Impact Calculator station
- Explain the purpose: "This tool shows the real financial cost of different credit scores"
- Demonstrate how to:
  - Select loan type (auto, mortgage, credit card, personal loan)
  - Enter loan amount and term
  - View interest rates across different credit score ranges
  - Compare monthly payments and total interest paid
- Point out the visual graph that illustrates cost differences

#### During the Activity
- Have students begin with a standard scenario: $25,000 auto loan for 60 months
- Direct them to compare interest rates and total costs across all credit score ranges
- After the initial example, encourage students to try scenarios relevant to their interests:
  - Future car purchase
  - Potential home mortgage
  - Credit card interest comparison
  - Student loan refinancing
- Ask students to calculate the lifetime difference between "fair" and "excellent" credit across multiple loans

#### Support Strategies
- For students who struggle with financial calculations, provide guided worksheets
- Create preset scenarios for students who need more structure
- Pair students who need support with those who demonstrate strong understanding
- Provide a reference chart showing typical interest rate ranges for common loans

#### Monitoring Points:
- Check that students are making the connection between credit scores and actual dollars
- Ensure students try multiple loan types to see how impact varies
- Listen for "aha moments" when students realize the significant financial impact
- Watch for students who may be overwhelmed by large numbers and provide context
- Note any misconceptions about interest rates for follow-up discussion

### Activity 3: Personal Credit Strategy Builder (15 minutes)

#### Setup & Introduction
- Direct students to the Personal Credit Strategy Builder station
- Explain that this tool will help them create a personalized plan for building and maintaining good credit
- Point out that their Day 1 reflections about easy/difficult credit factors should be visible
- Walk through the three timeline sections:
  - Short-term strategies (1-6 months)
  - Medium-term strategies (6-24 months)
  - Long-term strategies (2-5 years)
- Demonstrate how to select specific actions for each credit factor from the dropdown menus

#### During the Activity
- Encourage students to review their Day 1 reflections before starting
- Remind them to focus extra attention on the factors they identified as challenging
- Suggest they include at least one strategy for each of the five FICO components
- Emphasize the importance of realistic, actionable steps rather than vague goals
- Prompt students to consider their current financial situation and near-future plans (college, work, etc.)

#### Discussion Prompts:
- "How might your credit strategy need to adapt as you transition from high school to college or work?"
- "Which strategies did you select for your most challenging credit factor, and why?"
- "How will you hold yourself accountable to your credit strategy?"
- "Which aspects of your strategy will require changes to your current financial habits?"

**Guidance Note**: As students develop their strategies, emphasize that credit building is a marathon, not a sprint. Good credit requires consistent positive habits over time, not quick fixes. This is especially important for students who may be discouraged by the time it takes to build excellent credit.

### Portfolio Integration & Reflection (5 minutes)

#### Portfolio Completion
- Direct students to the Portfolio Integration section
- Explain that this brings together key elements from all three stations
- Guide students through reviewing their compiled work:
  - Key insights from the simulator
  - Financial impact calculations from the calculator
  - Personalized credit strategy
- Encourage students to refine their strategy based on insights from all activities

#### Sharing Insights
- Ask 2-3 volunteers to share one key insight from today's Learning Lab
- Invite students to share one specific action they plan to take based on their strategy
- Acknowledge the diversity of approaches, emphasizing there's no single "right" credit strategy
- Commend students for taking an important step toward financial literacy

#### Closing Message:
Credit scores are one of the most important yet often overlooked aspects of personal finance. The habits you begin forming now can significantly impact your financial opportunities for decades. By understanding how credit scores work and developing intentional strategies, you've taken a crucial step toward financial wellbeing. Remember that building excellent credit is a gradual process that rewards consistency and responsible management over time.
