## Section-by-Section Teaching Notes

### Learning Objectives

#### Teaching Notes
Guide students through the learning objectives, emphasizing the skills they'll develop rather than just information they'll acquire. This lesson focuses on practical decision-making skills related to borrowing money.

#### Facilitation Tips
- Begin with a quick poll: "How many of you have ever borrowed money, even from family or friends?" to establish relevance
- Use the objectives as a roadmap for the lesson, referring back to them at transition points
- Clarify that the goal is to develop decision-making skills, not to encourage or discourage borrowing

#### Objective Unpacking
- **Understand key differences between sources of credit**: Key points: Each source has distinct characteristics, advantages, disadvantages, and appropriate uses
- **Compare terms, interest rates, and fees**: Key points: Total cost of borrowing varies dramatically between sources; APR is the most comprehensive comparison tool
- **Evaluate creditworthiness and determine suitable credit sources**: Key points: Personal financial situation and credit history influence which options are available and appropriate
- **Analyze real-world scenarios**: Key points: Long-term financial health can be significantly impacted by borrowing choices; critical thinking skills are essential

### Introduction

#### Teaching Notes
The introduction should establish the relevance of credit sources to students' lives and set the context for why this knowledge matters. Emphasize that credit itself is neither inherently good nor badâ€”it's a tool that can be used wisely or unwisely.

#### Facilitation Tips
- Connect to students' lives by referencing purchases they might make soon (phones, cars, education)
- Consider using a brief video clip showing the reality of different credit scenarios
- Use a physical demonstration (e.g., different sized containers representing different loan amounts) to make abstract concepts concrete

#### Potential Misconceptions
- All debt is bad and should be avoided completely
- The lowest monthly payment always represents the best deal
- All credit sources charge roughly the same rates
- Payday loans are a reasonable option for short-term borrowing

#### Discussion Starters
- "Why might someone need to borrow money even if they're financially responsible?"
- "What's the difference between borrowing money for something that increases in value versus something that decreases in value?"
- "How could borrowing from family members be different than borrowing from a financial institution?"

### Key Concepts

#### Teaching Notes
The key concepts section introduces essential terminology that students need to understand before exploring different credit sources. Spend adequate time ensuring students grasp these fundamental concepts.

#### Facilitation Tips
- Create visual representations of each concept (e.g., a graph showing how APR affects total cost)
- Have students restate the definitions in their own words to check for understanding
- Use real-world examples to illustrate each concept (e.g., comparing car loans vs. credit cards to explain installment vs. non-installment credit)

#### Concept Deep Dives
- **Annual Percentage Rate (APR)**
  - Elaboration: Emphasize that APR includes both interest rate and fees, making it the most comprehensive measure of borrowing cost
  - Common confusion: Students often confuse interest rate with APR or don't understand why the same person might be offered different APRs for different loan types

- **Collateral**
  - Elaboration: Explain how collateral reduces risk for lenders, resulting in lower interest rates
  - Common confusion: Students may not realize that the lender can take possession of the collateral if the loan isn't repaid

- **Installment vs. Non-Installment Credit**
  - Elaboration: Use visual timelines to show payment structures for each type
  - Common confusion: Many students don't understand that revolving credit (like credit cards) can result in indefinite debt if only minimum payments are made

- **Creditworthiness**
  - Elaboration: Connect to previous lessons on credit scores if applicable
  - Common confusion: Students may not realize how their current actions can affect creditworthiness for years to come

#### Comprehension Check Questions
- "If Loan A has a 5% interest rate with a 2% origination fee and Loan B has a 6% interest rate with no fees, which likely has the lower APR?"
- "How does having collateral typically affect the interest rate on a loan?"
- "Why might someone choose a fixed installment loan over a credit card even if the credit card has a slightly lower APR?"

### Introduction to Credit Sources

#### Teaching Notes
This section introduces students to various credit sources and their characteristics. Use a comparative approach that helps students understand the appropriate uses, advantages, and disadvantages of each source.

#### Facilitation Tips
- Create a visual comparison chart showing key features of each credit source
- When discussing payday lenders, remain factual about costs while avoiding judgmental language
- Use case study personas to make the material more engaging (e.g., "Meet Alex, who needs to finance a used car...")
- Consider local relevance by highlighting credit sources that are common in your community

#### Discussion Questions
- "Why might a credit union offer lower interest rates than a traditional bank?"
- "What factors might make online lenders attractive despite having less personal interaction?"
- "Why do you think payday loans continue to exist despite their extremely high costs?"

#### Teaching Challenges & Solutions
- **Challenge**: Students from underbanked households may have limited exposure to traditional financial institutions
  - **Solution**: Acknowledge the real barriers to banking access and discuss community alternatives
- **Challenge**: Discussion of high-cost lenders can feel judgmental to students whose families may use these services
  - **Solution**: Focus on factual cost comparisons and systemic factors rather than individual choices

#### Subsection: Predatory Lending Practices
- Help students identify warning signs of predatory lending: excessive fees, prepayment penalties, loan flipping, and balloon payments
- Discuss alternatives to high-cost borrowing, including community assistance programs and credit union emergency loans
- Emphasize that predatory lending often targets vulnerable populations and communities

### Comparing Credit Options

#### Teaching Notes
This section helps students develop a framework for evaluating and comparing different credit options. Focus on practical analysis rather than just theoretical comparisons.

#### Facilitation Tips
- Use a live calculation demonstration to show how small differences in APR lead to large differences in total cost
- Have students work in pairs to calculate the total cost of a sample loan
- Create a decision-making checklist that students can use for future borrowing decisions
- Emphasize that non-cost factors (like customer service and repayment flexibility) can also be important

#### Example Analysis
- **Sample Calculation**: "If you borrow $1,000 at 18% APR for 12 months, your monthly payment would be approximately $91.68, and you'd pay about $100.17 in total interest. At 400% APR (typical of payday loans), you'd pay about $2,000 in interest for the same loan."
- Walk through the full calculation to show students how to determine the total cost of borrowing

#### Extension Activity
Have students calculate and compare the total cost of borrowing $2,000 from three different sources:
1. Credit union personal loan at 7% APR for 24 months
2. Credit card at 18% APR with minimum payments of 3% of the balance
3. Payday loan at 400% APR rolled over for 3 months, then paid in full

### Real-World Borrowing Scenarios

#### Teaching Notes
This section applies the concepts to concrete scenarios that students can relate to. Use these examples to illustrate how theoretical knowledge translates into practical decision-making.

#### Facilitation Tips
- Have students discuss in small groups which option they would choose for each scenario
- Use visual aids to show the total cost differences between options
- Connect scenarios to students' lives by using relevant examples (first car, college expenses, etc.)
- After each scenario, have students identify the key factors that made one option better than the others

#### Example Analysis
- **Emergency Car Repair Scenario**
  - Key points to emphasize: The dramatic difference in total cost between the credit union loan and payday loan; the importance of having emergency savings to avoid high-cost borrowing
  - Discussion questions: "What if the person didn't qualify for the credit union loan? What alternatives could they explore before turning to a payday loan?"

- **Financing a Used Car Scenario**
  - Key points to emphasize: Lower APR doesn't always mean the best deal if the term is much longer; the difference between wants and needs when making large purchases
  - Discussion questions: "How would extending the loan to 60 months affect the total cost and monthly payment? Would that be worth it?"

- **Home Renovation Scenario**
  - Key points to emphasize: Sometimes the best option depends on individual circumstances; secured vs. unsecured debt considerations
  - Discussion questions: "What are the risks of using a HELOC compared to a personal loan? When might the 0% intro APR credit card be the best option?"

#### Extension Activity
Ask students to create their own borrowing scenario based on a financial goal they might have in the next 5 years (e.g., buying a car, paying for education). Then have them research and compare at least three credit options for that scenario.

### Summary

#### Teaching Notes
Use the summary to reinforce key takeaways and ensure students can articulate the most important concepts from the lesson.

#### Facilitation Tips
- Have students generate the summary points rather than simply presenting them
- Create a visual reference chart of all credit sources covered with key characteristics
- Connect back to the learning objectives to show progression
- Explain how this knowledge will be applied in the Day 2 Learning Lab

#### Key Takeaways to Emphasize
- APR is the most comprehensive way to compare the cost of different credit options
- The lowest monthly payment often results in the highest total cost over time
- Credit sources vary dramatically in their costs, terms, and appropriate uses
- Building credit history and improving creditworthiness opens up more favorable borrowing options
- Having an emergency fund is the best way to avoid high-cost emergency borrowing

### Reflection Prompt

#### Teaching Notes
The reflection prompt helps students personalize the content and connect it to their own future decisions.

#### Facilitation Tips
- Give students adequate quiet time to formulate their responses
- Consider having students share their reflections in pairs before wider sharing
- Emphasize that there's no single "right" answerâ€”the goal is thoughtful consideration
- Connect the reflection to the upcoming Skill Builder activity

#### Additional Reflection Prompts
- "What surprised you most about the different credit sources we discussed today?"
- "How might your approach to borrowing be different from your parents' or grandparents' generation?"
- "What steps could you take now to ensure you have access to low-cost credit when you need it?"

#### Reflection-to-Skill Builder Connection
Make sure students understand how their reflections should inform their approach to the upcoming Skill Builder activity. This transition is crucial for helping students connect personal reflection to practical application.

### Skill Builder Activity

#### Activity Overview
The Comparing Credit Sources skill builder is the cornerstone of Day 1 content and connects directly to Day 2 learning activities. Students will analyze different credit sources and apply their knowledge to realistic borrowing scenarios.

**Key Connection**: This Skill Builder specifically connects to the Day 2 Learning Lab by establishing foundational knowledge about credit sources that will be applied in the Credit Source Analysis Challenge and Credit Cost Calculator activities. The work students complete here will be directly built upon during the Learning Lab.

#### Activity Objectives
- Correctly match appropriate credit sources to specific borrowing scenarios
- Justify credit source recommendations based on scenario details
- Analyze why high-cost lending options persist despite their drawbacks
- Identify alternatives to predatory lending options

#### Step-by-Step Facilitation
1. **Introduction (2 min)**: Explain that students will analyze credit sources and match them to appropriate scenarios
2. **Instructions & Examples (3 min)**: Walk through the chart of credit sources and one example scenario
3. **Individual Work (5 min)**: Have students work independently to match scenarios with appropriate lenders
4. **Progress Check (1 min)**: Ask if anyone is struggling with any particular scenarios
5. **Continued Work (3 min)**: Allow additional time for completion
6. **Sharing & Discussion (3 min)**: Review answers as a class, discussing any disagreements
7. **Reflection Question (3 min)**: Have students answer the reflection question about payday lending
8. **Connection to Day 2 (2 min)**: Explain how this foundation connects to the Day 2 Learning Lab activities

#### Common Challenges & Solutions
- **Challenge**: Students struggle to differentiate between similar credit sources
  - **Solution**: Create a simple comparison chart highlighting key differences
- **Challenge**: Wide variation in completion time
  - **Solution**: Have extension questions ready for quick finishers
- **Challenge**: Superficial responses to the reflection question
  - **Solution**: Provide prompting questions to deepen thinking
- **Challenge**: Students lack context about why someone might use high-cost credit
  - **Solution**: Discuss systemic barriers to banking access and emergency savings

#### Differentiation Strategies
- **For Students Who Need Support**:
  - Provide a partially completed chart
  - Offer a simpler version with fewer credit sources
  - Create a decision tree to help with the matching process
  - Pair with a stronger student for collaborative work

- **For Advanced Students**:
  - Ask them to calculate the total cost for each scenario
  - Have them research additional credit sources not covered in class
  - Challenge them to create their own scenarios with appropriate credit source matches
  - Assign research on legislation related to payday lending in your state

#### Examples & Models
- **Basic Example**: A student correctly matches an emergency car repair scenario with a credit union personal loan because of the moderate cost, fixed repayment term, and reasonable interest rate.
- **Exemplary Example**: A student not only matches scenarios correctly but also calculates the total cost of each option, provides detailed justifications for their choices, and suggests alternative approaches that might avoid borrowing entirely.

#### Connection to Day 2
The Skill Builder activity is directly connected to the Day 2 Learning Lab and serves as essential preparation. Make these connections explicit to students:
- Day 2, Station 1 (Credit Source Analysis Challenge) builds directly on the scenario matching in today's activity
- Day 2, Station 2 (Credit Cost Calculator) will allow students to calculate and visualize the cost differences they identified today
- The Borrower's Decision Matrix in Day 2 will expand on the criteria students used for matching in today's activity
- The Skill Builder will be referenced during the Day 2 portfolio development

**Important**: Ensure students save their Skill Builder work, as they will need it for Day 2 activities. Either have them submit digitally or keep physical copies in a secure location.

#### Assessment Guidance
When reviewing student work on the Skill Builder activity, look for:
- Correct matching of credit sources to appropriate scenarios
- Thoughtful justifications that reference specific characteristics of each credit source
- Understanding of why certain credit sources are more appropriate than others
- Depth of reflection about payday lending and alternatives
- Connections between borrowing decisions and long-term financial health

**Assessment Note**: This Skill Builder is a formative assessment opportunity. Provide feedback that will help students improve for Day 2 rather than focusing on grading.

**Feedback Approach**: When providing feedback, focus on one strength ("I notice you did an excellent job considering the long-term implications of each credit choice") and one area for growth ("For Day 2, consider exploring additional alternatives to high-cost borrowing options").
