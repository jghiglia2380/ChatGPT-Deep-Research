## Detailed Facilitation Notes

### Warm-up & Review (5 minutes)

- Begin by reminding students of the debt management strategies covered in Day 1: debt management plans, debt consolidation, debt settlement, and bankruptcy
- Present the three scenarios from the student content:
  - Recent college graduate with $5,000 in credit card debt across four cards who just started a stable job
  - Family with $75,000 in medical debt from emergency surgery, struggling to make minimum payments
  - Small business owner with $120,000 in business debt who has experienced significant income reduction
- Have students discuss with a partner which strategy might be most appropriate for each scenario
- After 3 minutes, call on volunteers to share their recommendations and reasoning
- Highlight responses that consider multiple factors beyond just debt amount (income stability, debt type, credit score)
- Use this warm-up to reinforce that the "best" strategy depends on individual circumstances

**Facilitation Tip**: Listen for misconceptions during pair discussions and address them during the sharing phase. This warm-up provides valuable formative assessment information about what students retained from Day 1.

### Activity 1: Debt Reduction Planning Workshop (15 minutes)

#### Setup & Introduction
- Divide students into groups of 3-4
- Distribute a different case study to each group (4-5 distinct scenarios that represent diverse financial situations)
- Explain that groups will analyze their case study and create a comprehensive debt reduction plan
- Review the components that should be included in their plan:
  - Debt prioritization strategy with rationale
  - Budget adjustments to increase debt payment capacity
  - Specific debt management strategy recommendations
  - Timeline for becoming debt-free
  - Contingency plans for potential setbacks

#### During the Activity
- Circulate among groups to provide guidance and ask probing questions
- Listen for misconceptions and address them with individual groups
- Encourage groups to be specific and realistic in their recommendations
- Remind students to consider both mathematical factors (interest rates, balances) and human factors (sustainability, quality of life)
- Alert groups when they have 5 minutes remaining to complete their plans

#### Group Sharing
- Have each group briefly present their case study and debt reduction plan to the class (1-2 minutes per group)
- After each presentation, invite one question or suggestion from another group
- Highlight effective strategies and creative solutions across the different presentations
- Note common themes that emerge across different scenarios

#### Key Questions to Pose:
- "How did your group decide which debts to prioritize first?"
- "What factors influenced your selection of a specific debt management strategy?"
- "What budget adjustments did you recommend, and how did you balance debt repayment with quality of life?"
- "What were the most challenging aspects of creating this plan?"

### Activity 2: Debt Consolidation Calculator (15 minutes)

#### Setup & Introduction
- Direct students to the appropriate online calculator tool
- Provide the structured scenario with detailed debt information:
  - Credit Card A: $3,000 at 22% APR, minimum payment $90
  - Credit Card B: $5,000 at 18% APR, minimum payment $150
  - Credit Card C: $2,500 at 24% APR, minimum payment $75
  - Auto Loan: $12,000 at 7.5% APR, payment $275
- Present the potential consolidation options:
  - Personal loan: 10.5% for 5 years with 2% origination fee
  - Home equity loan: 7% for 10 years with $500 in closing costs
  - Balance transfer card: 0% for 18 months, then 16%, with 3% transfer fee
- Demonstrate how to input the first debt into the calculator to ensure students understand the process

#### During the Activity
- Circulate to provide technical assistance with the calculator
- Challenge students to look beyond just the monthly payment to consider total interest paid
- Encourage students to test multiple scenarios, including consolidating only certain debts
- Prompt students to document their findings and recommendations
- Ask deeper questions about factors beyond the numbers (risk levels, disciplined spending habits)

#### Support Strategies
- Provide a step-by-step guide for using the calculator for students who need additional support
- Create a simplified version of the activity with fewer variables for struggling students
- Have an example of a completed analysis to share with students who need a model
- Allow students to work in pairs if they're having difficulty with calculations

#### Monitoring Points:
- Watch for students who are only looking at monthly payment without considering total interest
- Check that students are correctly inputting all fees and terms into their calculations
- Ensure students are documenting their analysis, not just playing with the calculator
- Look for students making assumptions about future behavior (like paying off the balance transfer card before the promotional rate expires)

### Activity 3: Bankruptcy Alternatives Analysis (15 minutes)

#### Setup & Introduction
- Assign students to four teams, each focused on one bankruptcy alternative:
  - Team 1: Credit counseling and debt management plans
  - Team 2: Debt settlement and negotiation
  - Team 3: Debt consolidation strategies
  - Team 4: Income increase and expense reduction methods
- Provide each team with starter research materials (articles, reputable websites)
- Explain the research expectations:
  - How the process works
  - Pros and cons
  - Who it works best for
  - Potential long-term impacts
  - Reputable resources and organizations
- Set the expectation that teams will create a visual presentation (poster, digital slides, or infographic)

#### During the Activity
- Circulate among teams to provide guidance and ensure they're focusing on key aspects
- Suggest specific sections of resources if teams seem overwhelmed
- Encourage teams to include specific examples or case studies
- Remind teams to focus on credible sources, particularly when researching debt settlement
- Alert teams when they have 5 minutes remaining to finalize their presentations

#### Discussion Prompts:
- "What are the most important factors someone should consider when evaluating this alternative?"
- "In what situations would this alternative be inappropriate or potentially harmful?"
- "How would you verify the legitimacy of organizations offering this service?"
- "What are some misconceptions about this alternative that people should be aware of?"

**Guidance Note**: Pay particular attention to the debt settlement team, as this area has many misleading commercial sources. Guide them toward government resources like the FTC or Consumer Financial Protection Bureau for accurate information.

### Activity 4: Credit Rebuilding Simulation (10 minutes)

#### Setup & Introduction
- Explain the credit rebuilding simulation structure:
  - Starting point: 520 credit score following a major debt event
  - Each round represents 6 months of financial decisions
  - Decision cards present choices related to credit applications, payment history, etc.
  - After each choice, students see the impact on their credit score
  - The goal is to rebuild to at least 680 within the simulated timeframe
- Demonstrate the first round with a sample decision and outcome
- Explain the journaling component where students record decisions and outcomes

#### During the Activity
- Clarify that this is an introduction to the simulation, which students will complete as homework
- Walk through the first two decision points together as a class
- Have students vote on which decision to make and discuss the reasoning
- Show how the decisions impact credit score and other financial metrics
- Discuss the compounding effect of consistent positive behaviors over time

#### Discussion Prompts:
- "What factors seem to have the biggest impact on credit score recovery?"
- "How long might it realistically take to substantially improve a very low credit score?"
- "Why might someone choose a secured credit card as part of their rebuilding strategy?"
- "What role does patience play in credit rebuilding?"

**Guidance Note**: Emphasize that credit rebuilding is a marathon, not a sprint. Many students may have misconceptions about how quickly credit can be rebuilt after significant financial setbacks.

### Portfolio Project Introduction (10 minutes)

- Prompt them to identify which case studies they might include

**Guidance Note**: This project allows students to synthesize learning from both Day 1 and Day 2 activities. Encourage creativity in presentation while maintaining accuracy of financial information.

### Reflection & Wrap-up (5 minutes)

#### Individual Reflection
- Have students independently answer the reflection questions from the student content:
  1. Which debt management strategy is most effective for someone with primarily credit card debt?
  2. What are the most important factors when deciding between debt settlement and bankruptcy?
  3. What advice would you give about seeking professional help for debt problems?
  4. What was most surprising about the credit rebuilding process?
- Allow 3 minutes for individual writing

#### Class Discussion
- Invite volunteers to share their responses to one question
- Highlight thoughtful responses that demonstrate understanding of key concepts
- Connect student reflections to activities completed during the Learning Lab
- Summarize key learning points from both days

#### Closing Message:
The strategies we've explored for managing high levels of debt and rebuilding credit are valuable tools in your financial toolkit. While we hope you won't face overwhelming debt personally, this knowledge enables you to make informed decisions if challenges arise and potentially help others who may be struggling. Remember that debt problems can usually be resolved with patience, discipline, and the right strategy for your specific situation.
