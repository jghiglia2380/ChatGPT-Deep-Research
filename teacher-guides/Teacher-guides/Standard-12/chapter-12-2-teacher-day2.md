## Detailed Facilitation Notes

### Warm-up & Entertainment Value Assessment (8 minutes)

- Distribute entertainment value assessment worksheets as students enter
- Explain that they'll be rating seven different leisure activities (including gambling) on five factors
- Guide students through the rating factors:
  - Enjoyment (personal pleasure derived)
  - Social Value (contribution to social connections)
  - Skill Development (learning or improving abilities)
  - Value for Money (return on financial investment)
  - Potential Downside (risk of negative consequences)

- After students complete their ratings (about 5 minutes), facilitate a short discussion:
  - Ask students to identify which activities scored highest/lowest overall
  - Discuss how gambling activities compared to other forms of entertainment
  - Explore what factors most influenced their ratings of gambling activities
  - Note how ratings might vary among different individuals based on preferences and values

**Facilitation Tip**: Emphasize that there are no "right" answers for these ratingsâ€”they're subjective and personal. This helps establish that gambling, like other entertainment choices, has different value for different people. Look for opportunities to connect to Day 1's concept of gambling as entertainment with an associated cost.

### Activity 1: Community Impact Analysis (12 minutes)

#### Setup & Introduction
- Divide class into small groups (3-4 students)
- Assign each group one of the three case studies:
  - Case Study 1: Riverdale Casino Development
  - Case Study 2: State Lottery Expansion
  - Case Study 3: Tribal Casino Development
- Distribute appropriate case study materials to each group
- Explain that groups will analyze both economic benefits and social costs

#### During the Activity
- Direct students to identify and quantify the economic benefits
- Guide them to identify and quantify the social costs
- Help groups analyze which population groups benefit most vs. bear most costs
- Encourage them to evaluate whether economic benefits outweigh social costs
- Support groups in suggesting policies to maximize benefits while minimizing costs
- Ask them to consider whether they would support similar gambling expansion locally

#### Group Sharing
- Have each group briefly present their key findings (1-2 minutes per group)
- Highlight similarities and differences between the three scenarios
- Ask students to identify common patterns across different gambling forms
- Draw attention to distribution of benefits and costs across population groups

#### Key Questions to Pose:
- "What surprised you most about the economic or social data in your case study?"
- "Did the benefits and costs affect all population groups equally? If not, how were they distributed?"
- "What policies might help maximize the benefits while minimizing the social costs?"
- "Based on your analysis, would you support similar gambling expansion in our community? Why or why not?"

### Activity 2: Gambling Psychology Exploration (12 minutes)

#### Setup & Introduction
- Have students work in pairs to explore gambling psychology
- Distribute gambling psychology exploration worksheets
- Explain that they'll examine three aspects of gambling psychology:
  - Motivations for gambling
  - Cognitive biases in gambling
  - Risk factors for problem gambling
- Emphasize the importance of understanding psychological factors that influence gambling decisions

#### During the Activity
- For Part 1 (Motivations), guide students to rate and explain eight different motivations:
  - Financial gain, entertainment/excitement, social interaction, escape
  - Skill mastery, competition, cultural traditions, status/prestige
- For Part 2 (Cognitive Biases), have students describe how seven biases influence gambling:
  - Gambler's fallacy, illusion of control, confirmation bias
  - Availability heuristic, loss aversion, sunk cost fallacy, near-miss effect
- For Part 3 (Risk Factors), ask students to discuss how eight factors contribute to problem gambling:
  - Early big win, accessibility, impulsivity, erroneous beliefs
  - Mental health issues, family history, financial pressure, loneliness/isolation

#### Support Strategies
- Circulate to provide examples and clarify concepts
- Encourage students to relate concepts to their own experiences with decision-making
- Provide real-world examples of how casinos or gambling platforms leverage these psychological principles
- Connect to responsible gambling strategies that counteract psychological vulnerabilities

#### Monitoring Points:
- Check that students understand the difference between motivations and cognitive biases
- Ensure pairs are discussing both sides of each factor (how it affects gambling behavior)
- Watch for oversimplified interpretations of psychological concepts
- Look for connections being made between psychology and responsible gambling strategies

### Activity 3: Responsible Gambling Campaign Development (12 minutes)

#### Setup & Introduction
- Organize students into groups of 3-4
- Explain that each group will develop a responsible gambling campaign targeted at young adults (18-25)
- Distribute campaign development materials and examples of existing campaigns
- Review the four components to develop:
  1. Campaign slogan and key messages
  2. Educational content outline
  3. Digital strategy
  4. Implementation plan

#### During the Activity
- Guide groups through the planning process:
  - Identify effective messaging approaches for young adults
  - Consider platforms and media young adults use
  - Balance educational content with engaging presentation
  - Think about measurement of effectiveness
- Encourage groups to apply insights from their gambling psychology exploration
- Remind students to incorporate knowledge from their Day 1 responsible gambling plans
- Suggest they consider how to address cognitive biases identified in the previous activity

#### Discussion Prompts:
- "What approach do you think would be most effective for reaching young adults?"
- "How can your campaign address the psychological factors that contribute to problem gambling?"
- "What digital platforms would be most effective for your campaign, and why?"
- "How can you measure whether your campaign is successful?"

**Guidance Note**: Remind students that effective public health messaging often focuses on empowerment rather than scare tactics. The most successful responsible gambling campaigns treat the audience with respect and provide practical tools rather than simply telling people what not to do.

### Portfolio Project Introduction (6 minutes)
