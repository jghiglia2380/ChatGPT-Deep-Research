## Detailed Facilitation Notes

### Warm-up & Review (5 minutes)

- Present five probability challenge scenarios related to common gambling activities (dice games, card draws, roulette, etc.).
- Have students work through calculations individually or in pairs.
- Quickly review the correct answers, emphasizing the mathematical principles behind each scenario.
- Connect these warm-up problems to the Day 1 concepts of probability, expected value, and the house edge.
- Address any common misconceptions observed in the Day 1 Skill Builder activity.

**Facilitation Tip**: Keep the warm-up fast-paced and engaging. These problems should be doable but challenging enough to activate students' thinking about probability and expected value calculations.

### Activity 1: Expected Value Casino (12 minutes)

#### Setup & Introduction
- Explain that students will design their own simple gambling games and then analyze them mathematically.
- Distribute the Expected Value Casino worksheet that guides students through creating and analyzing a game.
- Demonstrate a simple example: A dice game where players win $5 if they roll a 6, but lose $1 if they roll any other number.
- Walk through calculating the expected value: EV = (1/6 × $5) + (5/6 × -$1) = $0.83 - $0.83 = $0 (a fair game).
- Explain that most casino games are designed with a negative expected value for players.

#### During the Activity
- Have students design their own simple gambling games with clear rules and payouts.
- Guide them to analyze their games by calculating the exact expected value for the player.
- Challenge students to modify their games to create specific expected values (e.g., make it fair with EV=0, or create a house edge of 5%).
- Encourage students to think like casino designers: How would they ensure the game remains profitable over time?
- Have students swap games and analyze each other's designs.

#### Group Sharing
- Have 2-3 students present their games and expected value calculations to the class.
- Discuss how small changes in rules or payouts can significantly alter the expected value.
- Connect this activity to real casino game design and the mathematical principle that ensures casinos remain profitable.
- Ask students to identify which games would be most appealing to players despite having negative expected values.

#### Key Questions to Pose:
- "How did you ensure your game would be profitable for the 'house' over time?"
- "Which aspects of your game might make players feel like they have a good chance of winning, even though the expected value is negative?"
- "How could you disguise the negative expected value to make your game more appealing to players?"
- "What elements besides mathematical expectation might make a gambling game attractive to players?"

### Activity 2: The Gambler's Ruin Simulation (10 minutes)

#### Setup & Introduction
- Introduce the concept of "gambler's ruin" - the mathematical principle that explains why gamblers with finite resources playing against an opponent with infinite resources (like a casino) will eventually lose all their money.
- Explain the simulation: Students will use a digital tool that demonstrates how a gambler's bankroll changes over time when playing a game with negative expected value.
- Show how to set parameters: initial bankroll, bet size, house edge, and number of plays.
- Emphasize that this activity demonstrates the long-term mathematical reality of gambling, even if short-term results can vary.

#### During the Activity
- Have students run multiple simulations with different parameters:
  - A small bet size relative to bankroll (e.g., 1% of bankroll per bet)
  - A large bet size relative to bankroll (e.g., 10% of bankroll per bet)
  - Different house edge percentages (e.g., 1%, 5%, 15%)
  - Different numbers of plays (100, 1000, 10000)
- Ask students to record their observations about how quickly the bankroll depletes under different conditions.
- Encourage students to look for patterns in the simulation results.

#### Support Strategies
- For students struggling with the mathematical concepts, provide a simplified explanation focusing on the inevitable decline in bankroll over time.
- Offer a demo mode where you walk through the simulation step by step, explaining what's happening at each stage.
- Pair students who need support with more confident peers.
- Provide a structured observation sheet for recording simulation results.

#### Monitoring Points:
- Check that students understand how the house edge translates to a negative expected value on each bet.
- Ensure students are connecting the simulation to real-world gambling scenarios.
- Monitor for misconceptions about "winning streaks" or strategies that could "beat the system."
- Look for students who struggle to understand the long-term nature of probability and expected value.

### Activity 3: Gambling Decision Analysis (12 minutes)

#### Setup & Introduction
- Explain that while mathematics reveals the financial reality of gambling, decision-making often involves both mathematical and psychological factors.
- Distribute the Gambling Decision Analysis Framework worksheet that guides students through evaluating gambling scenarios.
- Present a sample scenario: "Your friend invites you to a casino night fundraiser for charity. The entry fee is $50, which goes to charity, and you'll receive $100 in 'casino chips' to play with for the evening."
- Demonstrate how to analyze this decision using both mathematical factors (expected value, total cost) and non-mathematical factors (social experience, charitable cause, entertainment value).

#### During the Activity
- Have students analyze 2-3 different gambling scenarios using the framework.
- Guide them to include calculations of expected costs based on house edge, frequency of play, and wager amount.
- Encourage students to consider the full range of factors beyond mathematics: social pressure, entertainment value, psychological factors.
- Have students determine where they would "draw the line" in each scenario based on their analysis.
- Challenge students to identify when the mathematical reality might be outweighed by other factors (e.g., entertainment value) and when it should be the primary consideration.

#### Discussion Prompts:
- "How much money would you be willing to lose for entertainment in different gambling contexts?"
- "What factors besides the negative expected value should influence responsible gambling decisions?"
- "How would you explain your decision-making process to someone who doesn't understand the mathematics of gambling?"
- "What mathematical thresholds would you establish for your own gambling decisions (e.g., maximum percentage of disposable income, maximum expected hourly cost)?"

**Guidance Note**: Maintain a focus on the mathematical analysis while acknowledging the reality that people may sometimes choose to gamble for entertainment despite the negative expected value. The goal is informed decision-making, not prohibition.

### Activity 4: Responsible Gambling Guidelines (10 minutes)

#### Setup & Introduction
- Explain that students will develop evidence-based responsible gambling guidelines that incorporate the mathematical principles they've learned.
- Distribute the Responsible Gambling Guidelines template.
- Clarify that these guidelines should be grounded in mathematical understanding but should also consider psychological factors.
- Provide examples of guidelines that are directly linked to mathematical principles (e.g., "Set a loss limit based on the known house edge and your entertainment budget").

#### During the Activity
- Have students work in pairs to develop at least five specific, actionable guidelines.
- Ensure each guideline is connected to a mathematical principle from Day 1 or Day 2.
- Encourage students to include specific calculation methods or thresholds in their guidelines.
- Have students create a visual representation of their guidelines that clearly communicates the mathematical principles.
- Ask pairs to swap guidelines for peer feedback, with a focus on the mathematical foundation of each guideline.

#### Discussion Prompts:
- "Which guideline do you think would be most effective in promoting responsible gambling decisions?"
- "How would you explain the mathematical reasoning behind your guidelines to someone with limited mathematical understanding?"
- "Which psychological factors might make it difficult for someone to follow these mathematically sound guidelines?"
- "How could gambling establishments incorporate these guidelines while still maintaining their business model?"

**Guidance Note**: Emphasize that these guidelines are about informed decision-making based on mathematical understanding, not moral judgments about gambling. The focus should be on how mathematical knowledge can lead to more responsible financial decisions.

### Portfolio Completion & Reflection (6 minutes)

#### Portfolio Completion
- Guide students to compile their work from all activities into a comprehensive gambling mathematics portfolio.
- Ensure the portfolio includes their Expected Value Casino game, Gambler's Ruin simulation analysis, Gambling Decision Framework, and Responsible Gambling Guidelines.
- Have students write a brief summary that connects all components and explains how mathematical understanding informs gambling decisions.
- Ask students to identify the most important mathematical principle they learned and explain its real-world application.
