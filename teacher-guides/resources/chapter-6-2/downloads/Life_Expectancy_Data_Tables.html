            <h3>Retirement Planning Implications:</h3>
            <p>While the median life expectancy provides a baseline, prudent retirement planning should consider higher percentiles to reduce longevity risk.</p>
            <p>Recommendations based on risk tolerance:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Conservative Planning:</strong> Use the 90th percentile (planning to age 95-97)</li>
                <li><strong>Moderate Planning:</strong> Use the 75th percentile (planning to age 91-92)</li>
                <li><strong>Minimum Planning:</strong> Use the median plus 3-5 years (planning to age 87-89)</li>
