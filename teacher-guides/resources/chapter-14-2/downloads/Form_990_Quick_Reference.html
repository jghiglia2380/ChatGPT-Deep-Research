    <h2>Introduction to Form 990</h2>
    <p>Form 990 is a tax document that nonprofit organizations must file annually with the Internal Revenue Service (IRS). It provides valuable information about an organization's mission, programs, finances, governance, and operations. Learning how to read Form 990 is an essential skill for evaluating charitable organizations.</p>
    
    <div class="tip">
        <strong>Finding Form 990s:</strong>
        <p>You can access Form 990s through:
            <ul>
                <li>GuideStar (guidestar.org)</li>

                <li>IRS Tax Exempt Organization Search (apps.irs.gov/app/eos)</li>
                <li>The organization's website (many transparent organizations post their forms)</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
    </div>
    
    <h2>Form 990 Overview</h2>
    <p>There are different versions of Form 990:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Form 990:</strong> Standard form for larger organizations (annual gross receipts ≥ $200,000 or total assets ≥ $500,000)</li>
        <li><strong>Form 990-EZ:</strong> Shorter version for mid-sized organizations</li>
        <li><strong>Form 990-N:</strong> Electronic postcard for small organizations</li>
        <li><strong>Form 990-PF:</strong> For private foundations</li>
    </ul>
    <p>This guide focuses primarily on the standard Form 990, which contains the most detailed information.</p>
    
    <h2>Key Sections to Review</h2>
    
    <div class="form-part">
        <h3>Header Information</h3>
        <p>The top of the first page contains basic identification information:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Legal Name:</strong> Official name registered with the IRS</li>
            <li><strong>EIN (Employer Identification Number):</strong> Unique 9-digit tax ID</li>
            <li><strong>Address:</strong> Official business address</li>
            <li><strong>Website:</strong> Organization's official website</li>
            <li><strong>Year Founded:</strong> When the organization was established</li>
            <li><strong>Tax Year:</strong> Period covered by the form</li>
        </ul>
        
        <div class="tip">
            <strong>Verification Tip:</strong>
            <p>Use the EIN to verify the organization's tax-exempt status through the IRS website. The EIN should match across all official documents.</p>
        </div>
    </div>
    
    <div class="form-part">
        <h3>Part I: Summary</h3>
        <p>This section provides a high-level overview of the organization:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Mission Statement (Line 1):</strong> Brief description of organizational purpose</li>
            <li><strong>Significant Activities (Line 2):</strong> Major programs or services</li>
            <li><strong>Governance (Lines 3-6):</strong> Number of voting board members, independent board members</li>
            <li><strong>Financial Snapshot (Lines 8-22):</strong> Key financial figures for current and previous year</li>
        </ul>
        
        <div class="warning">
            <strong>What to Watch For:</strong>
            <p>Compare current year to previous year figures. Significant unexplained changes might warrant further investigation. A healthy organization typically shows stable or growing revenue and sensible expense patterns.</p>
        </div>
    </div>
    
    <div class="page-break"></div>
    
    <div class="form-part">

        <div class="tip">
            <strong>Evaluation Focus:</strong>
            <p>This section reveals what the organization actually does. Look for:
                <ul>
                    <li>Specific accomplishments with measurable outcomes</li>
                    <li>Clear connection between mission and activities</li>
                    <li>Detailed information about who benefited from services</li>

        <ul>
            <li><strong>Board of Directors:</strong> Names, positions, and any compensation</li>
            <li><strong>Key Employees:</strong> Highly compensated staff</li>
            <li><strong>Hours:</strong> Time devoted to the organization</li>
            <li><strong>Compensation:</strong> Broken down by different types of payment</li>

        <div class="warning">
            <strong>Compensation Context:</strong>
            <p>Compensation should be evaluated in context of:
                <ul>
                    <li>Organization size and budget</li>
                    <li>Geographic location (cost of living varies)</li>
                    <li>Industry standards for similar roles</li>
                    <li>Complexity of the organization's operations</li>
                </ul>
                What might be reasonable for a large international organization could be excessive for a small local charity.

        <h3>Part VIII: Statement of Revenue</h3>

        </ul>
        
        <div class="tip">
            <strong>Diversification Analysis:</strong>
            <p>A healthy organization typically has diverse revenue sources. Heavy dependence on a single source (e.g., one major donor or government grants) can create vulnerability if that source disappears.</p>

    <div class="form-part">
        <h3>Part IX: Statement of Functional Expenses</h3>

        </ul>
        
        <div class="warning">
            <strong>Expense Ratio Calculation:</strong>
            <p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Program Expense Ratio:</strong> Program Services (Column B) ÷ Total Expenses (Column A)</li>
                    <li><strong>Administrative Ratio:</strong> Management and General (Column C) ÷ Total Expenses (Column A)</li>
                    <li><strong>Fundraising Ratio:</strong> Fundraising (Column D) ÷ Total Expenses (Column A)</li>

        <ul>
            <li><strong>Reason for Public Charity Status (Part I):</strong> Type of tax-exempt organization</li>
            <li><strong>Public Support Test (Parts II-III):</strong> Demonstrates broad public support rather than reliance on a few donors</li>
