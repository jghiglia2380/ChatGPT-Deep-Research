        <h3>Example: Health Insurance Payment Sequence</h3>
        <p>For a $10,000 medical bill with a plan having a $1,500 deductible, 20% co-insurance, and $4,000 out-of-pocket maximum:</p>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>First:</strong> You pay the $1,500 deductible</li>
            <li><strong>Second:</strong> You pay 20% co-insurance on the remaining $8,500 ($1,700)</li>
            <li><strong>Third:</strong> Since $1,500 + $1,700 = $3,200, which is below your $4,000 out-of-pocket maximum, you pay the full co-insurance amount</li>
            <li><strong>Result:</strong> You pay $3,200 total, insurance pays $6,800</li>

        <h3>Strategy Tip: Premium vs. Out-of-Pocket Costs</h3>
        <p>When choosing insurance plans, consider:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>High-deductible plans</strong> (lower premiums, higher out-of-pocket costs) may be better if you:
                <ul>
                    <li>Are generally healthy with few expected claims</li>
                    <li>Have adequate savings to cover potential deductibles</li>
                    <li>Want to minimize monthly expenses</li>
                    <li>Can utilize an HSA for tax advantages</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Low-deductible plans</strong> (higher premiums, lower out-of-pocket costs) may be better if you:
                <ul>
                    <li>Have chronic conditions requiring regular care</li>
                    <li>Anticipate significant medical expenses</li>
                    <li>Prefer more predictable monthly costs</li>
                    <li>Have limited savings for unexpected expenses</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <h2>Total Cost Estimation Formula</h2>
    <p>To estimate the total annual cost of an insurance plan:</p>
    <div class="example">
        <p><strong>Total Annual Cost = Annual Premium + Expected Out-of-Pocket Costs</strong></p>
        <p>Where Expected Out-of-Pocket Costs are calculated based on anticipated usage and can include:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Deductible payments (up to the full deductible)</li>
            <li>Co-payments for expected services</li>
            <li>Co-insurance payments for expected claims (after deductible)</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Note that out-of-pocket costs cannot exceed the out-of-pocket maximum.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="warning">
        <h3>Important: Insurance Terminology May Vary</h3>
        <p>Insurance terms and definitions can vary between different:</p>

            <li>Geographic regions due to state regulations</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Always review your specific policy documents and ask for clarification about any terms you don't understand.</p>
