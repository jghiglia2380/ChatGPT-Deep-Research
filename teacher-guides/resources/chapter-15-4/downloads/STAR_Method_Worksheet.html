        <h2>About the STAR Method</h2>
        <p>The STAR method is a structured approach to answering behavioral interview questions. Behavioral questions ask about your past experiences to predict your future performance. Using the STAR method helps you organize your responses to be clear, concise, and compelling.</p>
        
        <p><strong>STAR stands for:</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>S</strong>ituation: Describe the context or background</li>
            <li><strong>T</strong>ask: Explain your responsibility or challenge</li>
            <li><strong>A</strong>ction: Detail the specific steps you took</li>
            <li><strong>R</strong>esult: Share the outcomes and what you learned</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>Common Skills and Competencies</h2>
        <p>Below are common skills and competencies that employers seek. For each STAR response you develop, identify which of these skills your example demonstrates:</p>

        <h2>Example STAR Response</h2>
        
        <div class="example">
            <div class="example-title">Behavioral Question: "Tell me about a time when you had to solve a difficult problem."</div>
            
            <p><strong>Situation:</strong> During my senior project at school last semester, our team of five members was developing a mobile app with a tight four-week deadline. Two weeks in, one team member unexpectedly dropped the class, and they were responsible for a critical component of the app.</p>
            
            <p><strong>Task:</strong> As the project coordinator, I needed to ensure our team could still complete the project with high quality and meet our deadline, despite being unexpectedly short-staffed.</p>
            
            <p><strong>Action:</strong> I called an emergency team meeting to assess the situation. First, I analyzed exactly what work was left unfinished by the departing member. Then, I created a detailed inventory of each remaining team member's skills and current workload. Based on this information, I reorganized our tasks, redistributing the missing member's work based on each person's strengths rather than simply dividing it equally. I also created a more detailed project schedule with twice-weekly check-ins to monitor progress. Finally, I reached out to our instructor to ensure they were aware of the situation and to confirm what adjustments, if any, were possible.</p>
            
            <p><strong>Result:</strong> By redistributing work strategically rather than equally, we maximized efficiency. The twice-weekly check-ins helped us identify and solve problems quickly. We completed the project only one day later than our original deadline, and our app received an A grade. Our instructor specifically commended our adaptation to the challenge, and team members later told me they appreciated the organized approach to solving the problem.</p>
