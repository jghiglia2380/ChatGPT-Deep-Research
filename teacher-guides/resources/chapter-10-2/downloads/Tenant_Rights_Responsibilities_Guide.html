    <h1>Tenant Rights and Responsibilities Guide</h1>
    
    <p>Understanding your rights and responsibilities as a tenant is essential for a successful rental experience. This guide outlines the most common legal protections for tenants, your key responsibilities under typical lease agreements, and how to handle common rental situations.</p>
    
    <div class="note-box">
        <p><strong>Important Note:</strong> Tenant rights vary significantly by state, county, and even city. While this guide covers rights and responsibilities common to many jurisdictions, specific protections and obligations may differ based on your location. Always research the specific laws applicable to your area or consult with a tenant rights organization or legal aid service for location-specific information.</p>

    <h2>Common Tenant Rights</h2>
    
    <div class="right-section">
        <div class="right-title">Right to Habitable Housing</div>
        <p>Your landlord must provide housing that is safe, clean, and structurally sound with functioning essential systems.</p>
        <p><strong>This includes:</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li>Weatherproof roof and exterior walls</li>
            <li>Working plumbing and sewage systems</li>
            <li>Hot and cold running water</li>
            <li>Functioning heating system</li>

            <li>Functioning smoke and carbon monoxide detectors (in most jurisdictions)</li>
        </ul>
        <div class="tip-box">
            <p><strong>When to Assert This Right:</strong> If essential systems fail (heating, plumbing, electricity) or if hazardous conditions develop (mold, pest infestation, structural issues), notify your landlord in writing immediately. Document the issue with photos and keep copies of all communications.</p>
        </div>
    </div>
    
    <div class="right-section">
        <div class="right-title">Right to Privacy</div>
        <p>Your landlord cannot enter your rental unit without proper notice except in genuine emergencies.</p>
        <p><strong>Typical requirements include:</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li>24-48 hours' written notice before entry (varies by state)</li>
            <li>Entry only during reasonable hours (typically 9am-5pm on weekdays)</li>
            <li>Entry only for legitimate purposes (repairs, inspections, showing to prospective tenants)</li>
            <li>Immediate entry permitted only in genuine emergencies (fire, flood, gas leak)</li>
        </ul>
        <div class="tip-box">
            <p><strong>When to Assert This Right:</strong> If your landlord repeatedly enters without proper notice, document each occurrence. Send a written reminder about the notice requirement, citing your lease and state law. If violations continue, contact a tenant rights organization.</p>
        </div>
    </div>
    
    <div class="right-section">
        <div class="right-title">Right to Security Deposit Protections</div>
        <p>Your security deposit is protected by specific laws governing how it's held, used, and returned.</p>
        <p><strong>Common protections include:</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li>Limits on deposit amounts (often 1-2 months' rent maximum)</li>
            <li>Requirements that deposits be held in separate accounts</li>
            <li>Time limits for deposit return after move-out (typically 14-30 days)</li>
            <li>Right to an itemized statement of any deductions</li>
            <li>Deductions limited to unpaid rent and damages beyond normal wear and tear</li>
            <li>Right to dispute improper deductions</li>
        </ul>
        <div class="tip-box">
            <p><strong>When to Assert This Right:</strong> Document the condition of the unit when you move in (photos, video, written inventory). Request a move-out inspection. If your deposit is not returned within the legal timeframe or has improper deductions, send a written demand letter citing applicable laws.</p>
        </div>
    </div>
    
    <div class="right-section">
        <div class="right-title">Right to Fair Housing</div>
        <p>Federal and state fair housing laws protect you from discrimination based on protected characteristics.</p>
        <p><strong>Federal protections prohibit discrimination based on:</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li>Race or color</li>
            <li>National origin</li>
            <li>Religion</li>

            <li>Familial status (presence of children under 18)</li>
            <li>Disability</li>
        </ul>

            <li>Age</li>
            <li>Marital status</li>
            <li>Source of income (e.g., housing vouchers)</li>
            <li>Student status</li>
            <li>Military/veteran status</li>
        </ul>
        <div class="tip-box">
            <p><strong>When to Assert This Right:</strong> If you believe you've experienced housing discrimination, document all interactions, save all communications, and contact your local fair housing agency, HUD, or a fair housing advocacy organization.</p>
        </div>
    </div>
    
    <div class="right-section">
        <div class="right-title">Right to Repairs</div>
        <p>Your landlord must maintain the property in habitable condition and make repairs in a timely manner.</p>
        <p><strong>This typically includes:</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li>Responding to repair requests within a reasonable timeframe</li>
            <li>Making necessary repairs to keep the unit habitable</li>
            <li>Maintaining common areas in safe, clean condition</li>
            <li>Addressing safety and health hazards promptly</li>
        </ul>
        <div class="tip-box">
            <p><strong>When to Assert This Right:</strong> Always request repairs in writing (email, text, or letter) and keep copies. If important repairs are ignored, check your state laws regarding "repair and deduct" remedies or rent withholding options. In extreme cases, these remedies may be legally available, but they typically require strict documentation and procedure.</p>
        </div>
    </div>
    
    <div class="right-section">
        <div class="right-title">Right to Due Process</div>
        <p>Landlords must follow legal procedures for evictions and cannot engage in "self-help" evictions.</p>
        <p><strong>Prohibited "self-help" actions include:</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li>Changing locks without court order</li>
            <li>Removing doors or windows</li>
            <li>Shutting off utilities</li>
            <li>Removing tenant belongings</li>
            <li>Physical intimidation or threats</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>Proper eviction process typically includes:</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li>Written notice with specific time period</li>
            <li>Court filing if tenant doesn't comply with notice</li>
            <li>Court hearing where tenant can present defenses</li>
            <li>Court judgment if eviction is granted</li>
            <li>Enforcement by sheriff or constable only (not landlord)</li>
        </ul>
        <div class="tip-box">
            <p><strong>When to Assert This Right:</strong> If your landlord attempts to evict you without court process, contact local law enforcement, legal aid, or a tenant rights organization immediately. Document any attempts at illegal eviction.</p>
        </div>
    </div>
    
    <h2>Tenant Responsibilities</h2>
    
    <div class="responsibility-section">
        <div class="responsibility-title">Pay Rent on Time</div>

    </div>
    
    <div class="responsibility-section">
        <div class="responsibility-title">Maintain the Property</div>

        <div class="scenario-title">Scenario 3: Roommate Issues</div>
