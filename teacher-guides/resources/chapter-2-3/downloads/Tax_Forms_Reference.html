    <h2>Form Relationships and Flow</h2>
    <p>Understanding how forms relate to each other helps make sense of the tax filing process:</p>

    <ol>
        <li><strong>Information Gathering</strong>: You receive information returns (W-2s, 1099s, etc.) from various sources reporting your income and deductions.</li>
        <li><strong>Form Selection</strong>: Based on your situation, you determine which tax return forms you need (Form 1040 and any necessary schedules).</li>
        <li><strong>Information Transfer</strong>: You transfer information from your information returns to your tax return forms.</li>
        <li><strong>Calculations</strong>: You perform calculations or use tax software to determine your tax liability.</li>
        <li><strong>Submission</strong>: You submit your completed tax return forms to the IRS.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>When Each Form Is Used</h2>
    <p>Here's a quick reference for determining which schedules and forms you might need based on your situation:</p>
