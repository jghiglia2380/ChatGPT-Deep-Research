        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>
            This worksheet will guide you through developing a comprehensive student loan repayment strategy based on your educational plans, career goals, and financial situation. Having a plan before you borrow can help you make informed decisions about education financing and ensure that your student loans remain manageable after graduation.
        </p>
        
        <div class="tips">
            <strong>TIP:</strong> Regularly revisit and update your repayment strategy as your educational and career plans evolve. The most important time to develop this strategy is before you take out your first student loan, but it should be reviewed annually while in school and whenever your circumstances change.

                <strong>ROI Calculation:</strong> A simple way to estimate this is to divide your total education cost by your annual salary gain compared to having no degree. For example, if your degree costs $80,000 and increases your annual salary by $20,000, your ROI period would be approximately 4 years.

                <strong>Note:</strong> Income-driven repayment plans can be beneficial if you expect a lower starting salary relative to your debt. However, they may result in paying more interest over time. Standard repayment minimizes total interest paid but requires higher monthly payments.

                <strong>Federal Loan Protections:</strong> Federal student loans offer deferment and forbearance options for economic hardship, as well as income-driven repayment plans that adjust your payment based on your income. Private loans typically offer fewer protections, which is why they should be considered only after exhausting federal loan options.
