    <h2>Who Needs to File Taxes?</h2>
    <p>Whether you need to file a tax return depends on a few factors, including:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>How much income you earned during the year</li>
      <li>Where that income came from (employment, self-employment, investments, etc.)</li>  
      <li>Your filing status (single, married, head of household)</li>
      <li>Your age</li>
    </ul>
    <p>In general, if you are a single dependent under age 65, you must file a tax return if you had income above these amounts in 2022:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Unearned income (interest, dividends) was more than $1,150</li>
      <li>Earned income (salaries, wages) was more than $12,950</li>
      <li>Your gross income was more than $1,150 or $400 from self-employment</li>
    </ul>
  </div>

    <h3>Real-World Example</h3>
    <p>Let's say Emily, 17, worked part-time at a grocery store last year and earned $5,000. She also earned $50 in interest from her savings account. Since both her earned and unearned income were below the thresholds, she likely does not need to file a tax return this year.</p>
  </div>
   
  <div class="section"> 
    <h2>Reasons to File Even If Not Required</h2>
    <p>Even if you aren't legally required to file a tax return, there may still be good reasons to do so:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>To get a refund of taxes withheld from your paycheck</li>
      <li>To claim certain tax credits you may be eligible for</li>
      <li>To establish a record of filing, which can be helpful when applying for loans, etc.</li>
    </ul>
