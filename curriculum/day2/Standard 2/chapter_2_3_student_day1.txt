  <h1>Chapter 2.3: Understanding Tax Filing Requirements</h1>
  
  <h2>What Does It Mean to File Taxes?</h2>
  <p>Filing taxes means submitting information about your income and expenses to the government each year. This allows the government to calculate how much tax you owe based on the tax laws. Most people in the United States are required to file a federal income tax return annually.</p>
  
  <h2>Who Needs to File Taxes?</h2> 
  <p>Whether you need to file a tax return depends on a few factors:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Your income level</li>
    <li>Your filing status (single, married, head of household)</li>  
    <li>Your age</li>
    <li>Whether you are claimed as a dependent on someone else's taxes</li>
  </ul>
  <p>In general, once your income reaches a certain threshold, you are required to file taxes. Here are the income thresholds for different filing statuses in 2022:</p>

  <h2>When Are Taxes Due?</h2>

    <li>If you are out of the country on the tax deadline, you generally get an automatic 2-month extension to file</li>
