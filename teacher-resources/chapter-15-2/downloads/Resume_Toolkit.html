    <h3>Quantification When Numbers Aren't Obvious</h3>

        </ul>
        <p><strong>Administrative Role:</strong></p>

    <h2>Resume Formatting Guidelines</h2>
    <p>A well-formatted resume is easy to scan quickly and presents information clearly and professionally.</p>

    <h3>General Formatting Principles</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Length:</strong> 1 page for most students and entry-level professionals; 2 pages acceptable for those with significant experience</li>
        <li><strong>Margins:</strong> 0.5-1 inch on all sides (avoid going smaller than 0.5 inch)</li>
        <li><strong>Font:</strong> Professional, readable fonts (Arial, Calibri, Garamond, Helvetica) in 10-12pt size</li>
        <li><strong>Spacing:</strong> Consistent line spacing throughout (single or 1.15 spacing is standard)</li>
        <li><strong>Alignment:</strong> Left-aligned text (not justified) for better readability</li>
        <li><strong>File Format:</strong> Save and send as PDF to preserve formatting</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Visual Hierarchy</h3>
    <p>Use formatting to guide the reader's eye to the most important information:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Section Headers:</strong> Larger font, bold, and/or color to clearly separate sections</li>
        <li><strong>Company/School Names:</strong> Bold and/or uppercase to stand out</li>
        <li><strong>Position Titles:</strong> Italics or different formatting from organization names</li>
        <li><strong>Dates:</strong> Consistent placement (typically right-aligned) and format (Month Year)</li>
        <li><strong>Bullet Points:</strong> Consistent indentation and symbol</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Consistency</h3>
    <p>Maintain consistent formatting for similar elements throughout your resume:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Use the same date format everywhere (e.g., September 2023 or 09/2023, not both)</li>
        <li>Apply the same treatment to all section headers</li>
        <li>Use the same bullet point symbol and indentation</li>
        <li>Maintain consistent spacing between sections</li>
        <li>Apply the same formatting to parallel elements (job titles, organization names)</li>
    </ul>

    <div class="warning-box">
        <h4>Formatting Don'ts:</h4>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Don't</strong> use multiple font types in one resume (stick to 1-2 complementary fonts)</li>
            <li><strong>Don't</strong> overuse bold, italics, or underlining (use sparingly for emphasis)</li>
            <li><strong>Don't</strong> include photos, graphics, or decorative elements unless relevant to your field</li>
            <li><strong>Don't</strong> use templates with elaborate designs that distract from content</li>
            <li><strong>Don't</strong> crowd the page with dense text (maintain adequate white space)</li>
            <li><strong>Don't</strong> use tables or columns that might confuse Applicant Tracking Systems (ATS)</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <h3>ATS Compatibility</h3>
    <p>Many employers use Applicant Tracking Systems to screen resumes before human review:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Use standard section headings (e.g., "Experience" not "Where I've Worked")</li>
        <li>Avoid text boxes, headers/footers, and images (ATS may not read these correctly)</li>
        <li>Minimize special characters and symbols</li>
        <li>Use standard bullet points (•) rather than decorative symbols</li>
        <li>Include keywords from the job description in your resume text</li>
        <li>Submit in the requested file format (usually PDF or Word)</li>
    </ul>
