            <strong>Example Scenario:</strong> Sophia has a PPO health insurance plan with a $1,500 deductible, 20% co-insurance, and $4,000 out-of-pocket maximum. When she needs an appendectomy costing $20,000, she pays the first $1,500 (deductible), plus 20% of the remaining $18,500 ($3,700), but since that exceeds her out-of-pocket maximum, she only pays $4,000 total. Her insurance covers the remaining $16,000.
