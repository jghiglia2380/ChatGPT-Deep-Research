    <h1>Tax Policy Proposal Template</h1>
    
    <p>This template will guide you through creating a comprehensive tax policy proposal. Complete each section thoughtfully, using evidence and reasoning to support your positions. The most effective policy proposals are specific, evidence-based, and consider multiple perspectives.</p>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>1. Executive Summary</h2>
        <p>Provide a brief overview of your tax policy proposal. Summarize the problem, your proposed solution, and the expected benefits. (1-2 paragraphs)</p>
        
        <div class="tip">
            <strong>Tip:</strong> Write this section last, after completing all other sections. Focus on clarity and brevity.
        </div>

        <p>Describe the specific tax issue or problem you aim to address. Explain why this problem matters and who is affected by it.</p>
        
        <div class="examples">
            <strong>Example:</strong> "The current mortgage interest deduction disproportionately benefits high-income homeowners while providing minimal support to middle and lower-income families. This inequity in the tax code reduces housing affordability for those who need it most and costs the federal government approximately $70 billion annually in foregone revenue."
        </div>
        
        <h3>Key Elements to Include:</h3>
        <ul>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>4. Policy Objectives</h2>
