            <div class="timeline">Post-Debt Settlement or Bankruptcy</div>
            
            <p>At this stage, your credit score is significantly damaged due to debt settlement, bankruptcy, or severe delinquencies. This is your starting point for rebuilding, not a permanent situation. With strategic actions and time, your credit will improve.</p>
            
            <div class="actions">
                <h3>Initial Steps:</h3>
                <ul class="action-list">
                    <li>Review your credit reports from all three bureaus (Experian, Equifax, TransUnion) for accuracy</li>

                    <li>Create a realistic household budget that prevents new debt</li>
                    <li>Build an emergency fund of at least $1,000 to avoid credit dependence</li>
                    <li>Develop the habit of checking your credit report quarterly</li>

                <h4>Important to Know:</h4>
                <p>At this stage, you'll have very limited access to credit. Most offers you receive will have high fees and interest rates. Be extremely cautious about accepting new credit and focus on establishing financial stability first.</p>

    <h2>Critical Factors for Successful Credit Rebuilding</h2>
    
    <div class="tip">
        <h4>Payment History (35% of FICO Score)</h4>
        <p>Your payment history is the largest component of your credit score. A single missed payment can set back your progress by months. Always pay at least the minimum payment by the due date. Setting up automatic payments can help ensure you never miss a due date.</p>
    </div>
    
    <div class="tip">
        <h4>Credit Utilization (30% of FICO Score)</h4>
        <p>Keep your credit card balances below 30% of your credit limits. For even better results, aim for 10-20% utilization. For example, if your card has a $1,000 limit, try to keep the balance below $300, or ideally below $200.</p>
    </div>
    
    <div class="tip">
        <h4>Length of Credit History (15% of FICO Score)</h4>
        <p>The longer your accounts have been open, the better for your score. Avoid closing old accounts, even if you don't use them frequently. Consider making a small purchase every few months to keep the account active.</p>
    </div>
    
    <div class="tip">
        <h4>Credit Mix (10% of FICO Score)</h4>
        <p>Having a mix of different credit types (revolving credit like credit cards and installment loans like auto loans) shows you can manage different types of credit responsibly. Don't take on debt just to diversify, but consider this factor when you do need to borrow.</p>

    <div class="tip">
        <h4>New Credit (10% of FICO Score)</h4>
        <p>Each credit application generates a hard inquiry that temporarily lowers your score. Limit applications to when you truly need new credit, and try to group applications for the same type of credit (like auto loans) within a 14-day period so they count as a single inquiry.</p>

        <h4>Watch Out for These Credit Rebuilding Pitfalls:</h4>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Credit repair scams</strong> - No one can legally remove accurate negative information from your credit report</li>
            <li><strong>High-fee credit cards</strong> - Some cards targeted at those with bad credit charge excessive fees</li>
            <li><strong>Closing accounts after paying them off</strong> - This can reduce your available credit and hurt your utilization ratio</li>
            <li><strong>Applying for too many accounts at once</strong> - This creates multiple hard inquiries and may flag you as a credit risk</li>
            <li><strong>Relying on credit monitoring companies</strong> - You can check your official credit reports for free at AnnualCreditReport.com</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Success Story: Jennifer's Credit Recovery</h4>
        <p>"After settling $30,000 in credit card debt, my score dropped to 520. I started with a secured card and a credit-builder loan. I was religious about making payments on time and keeping my utilization low. After 24 months, my score was 680, and I qualified for a conventional auto loan. By year three, I was at 720 and bought a home with a competitive mortgage rate. It wasn't quick or easy, but the systematic approach worked."</p>
