    <h1>SMART Career Goals Guide</h1>
    <p><strong>Chapter 15.1: Career Exploration and Goal Setting</strong></p>

    <h2>Introduction to SMART Goal Setting</h2>
    <p>Setting effective goals is essential for career development. The SMART framework provides a structured approach to creating goals that are clear, actionable, and more likely to be achieved. This guide will help you understand and apply the SMART framework to your career planning.</p>

    <div class="example-box">
        <h3>What are SMART Goals?</h3>
        <p>SMART is an acronym that stands for:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>S</strong>pecific: Well-defined and focused</li>
            <li><strong>M</strong>easurable: Includes concrete criteria for measuring progress</li>
            <li><strong>A</strong>chievable: Realistic and attainable</li>
            <li><strong>R</strong>elevant: Aligned with your broader goals and values</li>
            <li><strong>T</strong>ime-bound: Has a clear deadline or timeframe</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <h2>The SMART Framework in Detail</h2>

    <div class="goal-section">
        <h3>S - Specific</h3>
        <p>Specific goals answer the five "W" questions:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>What</strong> exactly do I want to accomplish?</li>
            <li><strong>Why</strong> is this goal important?</li>
            <li><strong>Who</strong> is involved?</li>
            <li><strong>Where</strong> will it take place?</li>
            <li><strong>Which</strong> resources or limits are involved?</li>
        </ul>
        
        <div class="example-box">

    <h2>Common Pitfalls in Career Goal Setting</h2>
    
    <div class="pitfall-box">
        <h3>Watch Out For These Common Mistakes</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Setting too many goals at once</strong>: Focus on a few high-priority goals rather than trying to accomplish everything simultaneously.</li>
            <li><strong>Creating vague goals</strong>: Avoid general statements like "get a good job" or "improve my skills" without specifics.</li>
            <li><strong>Setting goals based on others' expectations</strong>: Ensure your goals reflect your own values and aspirations, not just what others think you should do.</li>
            <li><strong>Failing to write goals down</strong>: Written goals are more likely to be accomplished than those kept only in your mind.</li>
            <li><strong>Not revisiting or adjusting goals</strong>: Circumstances change—be willing to refine your goals as you gain new information or experience shifts in priorities.</li>
            <li><strong>Neglecting to create an action plan</strong>: A goal without specific action steps is just a wish.</li>
            <li><strong>Setting only outcome goals without process goals</strong>: Include goals about what you'll do (process) as well as what you'll achieve (outcome).</li>
        </ul>
