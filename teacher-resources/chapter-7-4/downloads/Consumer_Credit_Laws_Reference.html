    <div class="law-section">
        <div class="law-title">Truth in Lending Act (TILA)</div>
        
        <p><strong>Overview:</strong> TILA ensures that consumers receive clear, accurate information about credit terms and costs before entering into credit agreements. It applies to most types of consumer credit, including credit cards, mortgages, auto loans, and personal loans.</p>
        
        <p><strong>Key Protections in Detail:</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Disclosure Requirements:</strong> Lenders must provide standardized disclosure forms showing APR, finance charges, amount financed, total payments, and payment schedule</li>
            <li><strong>Right of Rescission:</strong> For certain home loans, consumers have three business days to reconsider and cancel the loan after signing</li>
            <li><strong>Advertising Regulations:</strong> If credit ads mention specific terms (like down payment or interest rate), they must include other key terms like APR</li>
            <li><strong>Billing Error Resolution:</strong> Procedures for disputing billing errors on credit accounts</li>
            <li><strong>Limitations on Liability:</strong> Caps consumer liability for unauthorized credit card charges at $50</li>
        </ul>
        
        <div class="example-box">
            <p><strong>Example:</strong> When applying for an auto loan, the lender must provide a disclosure form showing the APR, all fees, the total cost of the loan over its term, and the monthly payment amount. This allows you to make an informed decision and compare different loan offers.</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="violation-box">
            <p><strong>Common Violations:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Failing to disclose all fees in the APR calculation</li>
                <li>Advertising a low interest rate without disclosing the APR</li>
                <li>Not providing required disclosures before loan closing</li>
                <li>Failing to honor rescission requests within the allowed timeframe</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
        
        <div class="action-box">
            <p><strong>How to Assert Your Rights:</strong></p>
            <ol>
                <li>Request all disclosures in writing before agreeing to any loan</li>
                <li>Compare the APR, not just the interest rate, across different offers</li>
                <li>Keep copies of all credit agreements and disclosure forms</li>
                <li>If you suspect a violation, file a complaint with the CFPB</li>

    <div class="law-section">
        <div class="law-title">Fair Credit Reporting Act (FCRA)</div>
        
        <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The FCRA regulates how consumer credit information is collected, used, and shared. It gives consumers the right to know what's in their credit reports and to dispute inaccurate information.</p>
        
        <p><strong>Key Protections in Detail:</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Access to Credit Reports:</strong> You can request a free copy of your credit report from each of the three major credit bureaus (Equifax, Experian, and TransUnion) once every 12 months through AnnualCreditReport.com</li>
            <li><strong>Dispute Rights:</strong> You have the right to dispute inaccurate or incomplete information on your credit report, and credit bureaus must investigate within 30 days</li>
            <li><strong>Adverse Action Notices:</strong> If you're denied credit, insurance, or employment based on information in your credit report, you must be notified and given information about how to get a free copy of the report used</li>
            <li><strong>Time Limits on Negative Information:</strong> Most negative information must be removed after 7 years (bankruptcies after 10 years)</li>
            <li><strong>Access Restrictions:</strong> Credit reports can only be accessed by entities with a permissible purpose (like creditors, insurers, or employers with your permission)</li>
        </ul>
        
        <div class="example-box">
            <p><strong>Example:</strong> If you discover an account on your credit report that you never opened, you have the right to dispute this information with the credit bureau. The bureau must investigate and remove the information if it cannot be verified as accurate.</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="violation-box">
            <p><strong>Common Violations:</strong></p>

        <div class="law-title">Equal Credit Opportunity Act (ECOA)</div>
        
        <p><strong>Overview:</strong> ECOA prohibits discrimination in any aspect of credit transactions based on protected characteristics. It ensures that all consumers have equal access to credit if they qualify financially.</p>
        
        <p><strong>Key Protections in Detail:</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Protected Characteristics:</strong> Creditors cannot discriminate based on race, color, religion, national origin, sex, marital status, age (if you're old enough to enter a contract), receipt of public assistance, or exercise of rights under consumer protection laws</li>
            <li><strong>Application Procedures:</strong> Creditors can't discourage applications based on protected characteristics</li>
            <li><strong>Notification Requirements:</strong> Creditors must inform applicants of action taken on applications within 30 days</li>
            <li><strong>Reasons for Denial:</strong> Upon request, creditors must provide specific reasons for credit denial or adverse action</li>
            <li><strong>Income Consideration:</strong> Creditors must consider all income, including part-time income, alimony, child support, etc., if regularly received</li>
        </ul>
        
        <div class="example-box">
            <p><strong>Example:</strong> A lender cannot reject your loan application simply because you're on parental leave if you can demonstrate that your income will continue or resume. Similarly, a creditor cannot require a spouse's signature on a loan if you individually qualify.</p>
        </div>

            <p><strong>Common Violations:</strong></p>
