        <p>Morgan has had a credit card with National Bank for three years with a fixed interest rate of 15.9% APR.

        <p>Jamie has been receiving calls from ABC Collections about a three-year-old medical debt of $750. The collector calls every day, including weekends, sometimes as early as 6:00 AM and as late as 11:00 PM. During their last call, the collector threatened to tell Jamie's employer about the debt and said they would "make sure everyone knows you don't pay your bills." Jamie doesn't recognize the debt and has asked for verification, but the collector continues to demand immediate payment.</p>

        <p>Taylor and Jordan, a married couple, applied for a mortgage loan. Both have good credit scores above 750 and stable income that easily qualifies them for the loan amount. After submitting their application, they were denied without explanation. When they called to ask why, the loan officer mentioned that their application was denied because Jordan is on parental leave, even though Jordan will return to work in two months and their current income is still sufficient for the loan.</p>

        <p>Riley took out federal student loans to pay for college. After graduation, Riley started receiving bills from three different loan servicers with different payment amounts, due dates, and terms.

One servicer is now threatening to report late payments, even though Riley never received clear payment instructions.</p>
