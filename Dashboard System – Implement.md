PFL Academy Dashboard System – Implementation via ChatGPT-Deep-Research Repository
I’ve created a clean, consolidated repository (ChatGPT-Deep-Research) that combines all relevant content and dashboard code from the PFL Academy platform. This repo is safe for full development and structural refinement. You are free to build and reorganize within it to implement missing functionality across Admin, Instructor, and Student dashboards.

Please focus your implementation inside:

bash
Copy
Edit
/dashboards/           – all dashboard interfaces  
/skill-builders/       – reusable components  
/curriculum/day1/      – direct instruction content  
/curriculum/day2/      – interactive lab content  
🎯 Project Goals
Implement full functionality for three interconnected dashboards (Admin, Instructor, Student) by completing the assessment system, enhancing user role support, and building dynamic assignment flows.

🛠️ Core Functional Requirements
1. Admin Dashboard
 Grade weighting config (Supabase table: grade_weighting)

 Teacher permissions editor (canEditCurriculum, canManageAssessments, canViewReports)

 Curriculum configuration (state-specific customizations)

 Assessment Library:

Create/edit assessments

Save to Supabase assessments table

Identify and scaffold missing DB components or frontend UIs

2. Assessment System (Central Feature)
 Migrate quizzes.json into Supabase assessments table

 Admins create and manage assessments (Admin Dashboard)

 Instructors assign assessments to students (Instructor Dashboard)

 Students complete assessments (Student Dashboard)

 Grading system with optional AI evaluation for objective items

3. Instructor Dashboard
 Assignment creation (assessment + class/students + due date + instructions)

 View assignment completion status

 Review responses and provide feedback

4. Student Dashboard
 View assigned assessments

 Complete assessments and submit responses

 Receive scores and instructor feedback

🔗 Dashboard Interconnections
Implement data flow across Admin → Instructor → Student

Use Supabase role-based access control based on schema.sql

Maintain a consistent UI/UX across dashboards

🧱 Data Layer Requirements
Define TypeScript interfaces that match schema.sql

Implement Supabase-based CRUD operations

Add middleware for permissions, validation, and error handling

📦 Required DB Enhancements
Implement the following new tables in Supabase (you may scaffold them within /supabase/schema.sql or connect to existing structure):

sql
Copy
Edit
-- Assignment-level metadata
create table assignments (
  id uuid primary key default uuid_generate_v4(),
  assessment_id uuid references assessments(id) not null,
  teacher_id uuid references users(id) not null,
  class_id text,
  title text not null,
  instructions text,
  due_date timestamp with time zone not null,
  created_at timestamp with time zone default timezone('utc'::text, now()) not null
);

-- Individual student work + grading
create table student_assignments (
  id uuid primary key default uuid_generate_v4(),
  assignment_id uuid references assignments(id) not null,
  student_id uuid references users(id) not null,
  status text not null default 'assigned',
  start_time timestamp with time zone,
  submit_time timestamp with time zone,
  responses jsonb,
  score numeric,
  feedback text,
  created_at timestamp with time zone default timezone('utc'::text, now()) not null
);
📁 Implementation Guidelines
✅ You can update file/folder structure in this repo as needed

✅ Focus on functionality and developer-friendly structure

✅ Clearly comment new logic, especially around Supabase integration

✅ Modularize components for reuse across dashboards

❌ Do not sync these changes back to the original live repos unless approved

🧠 Dependencies
Supabase (auth + database + RLS)

React/TypeScript

TailwindCSS

Chart.js

React Router

🧪 Suggested Starting Point
Start by implementing the Admin Assessment Library UI and Supabase integration, then move to Instructor > Student flows. Build iteratively, using modular components and shared TypeScript types for assessments and assignments.
